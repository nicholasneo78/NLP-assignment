INTRODUCTION
This tutorial provides an overview of natural
language processing (NLP) and lays a foundation
for the JAMIA reader to better appreciate the articles in this issue.
NLP began in the 1950s as the intersection of
artiﬁcial intelligence and linguistics. NLP was originally distinct from text information retrieval (IR),
which employs highly scalable statistics-based
techniques to index and search large volumes of
text efﬁciently: Manning et al1 provide an excellent
introduction to IR. With time, however, NLP and
IR have converged somewhat. Currently, NLP
borrows from several, very diverse ﬁelds, requiring
today’s NLP researchers and developers to broaden
their mental knowledge-base signiﬁcantly.
Early simplistic approaches, for example, wordfor-word Russian-to-English machine translation,2
were defeated by homographsdidentically spelled
words with multiple meaningsdand metaphor,
leading to the apocryphal story of the Biblical, ‘the
spirit is willing, but the ﬂesh is weak’ being translated to ‘the vodka is agreeable, but the meat is
spoiled.’
Chomsky’s 1956 theoretical analysis of language
grammars3 provided an estimate of the problem’s
difﬁculty, inﬂuencing the creation (1963) of BackusNaur Form (BNF) notation.4 BNF is used to specify
a ‘context-free grammar’5 (CFG), and is commonly
used to represent programming-language syntax. A
language’s BNF speciﬁcation is a set of derivation
rules that collectively validate program code
syntactically. (‘Rules’ here are absolute constraints,
not expert systems’ heuristics.) Chomsky also
identiﬁed still more restrictive ‘regular’ grammars,
the basis of the regular expressions6 used to specify
text-search patterns. Regular expression syntax,
544

deﬁned by Kleene7 (1956), was ﬁrst supported by
Ken Thompson’s grep utility8 on UNIX.
Subsequently (1970s), lexical-analyzer (lexer)
generators and parser generators such as the lex/yacc
combination9 utilized grammars. A lexer transforms
text into tokens; a parser validates a token sequence.
Lexer/parser generators simplify programminglanguage implementation greatly by taking regularexpression and BNF speciﬁcations, respectively, as
input, and generating code and lookup tables that
determine lexing/parsing decisions.
While CFGs are theoretically inadequate for
natural language,10 they are often employed for
NLP in practice. Programming languages are typically designed deliberately with a restrictive CFG
variant, an LALR(1) grammar (LALR, Look-Ahead
parser with Left-to-right processing and Rightmost
(bottom-up) derivation),4 to simplify implementation. An LALR(1) parser scans text left-to-right,
operates bottom-up (ie, it builds compound
constructs from simpler ones), and uses a look-ahead
of a single token to make parsing decisions.
The Prolog language11 was originally invented
(1970) for NLP applications. Its syntax is especially
suited for writing grammars, although, in the
easiest implementation mode (top-down parsing),
rules must be phrased differently (ie, right-recursively12) from those intended for a yacc-style parser.
Top-down parsers are easier to implement than
bottom-up parsers (they don’t need generators),
but are much slower.

The limitations of hand-written rules: the rise of
statistical NLP
Natural language’s vastly large size, unrestrictive
nature, and ambiguity led to two problems when
using standard parsing approaches that relied
purely on symbolic, hand-crafted rules:
< NLP must ultimately extract meaning (‘semantics’) from text: formal grammars that specify
relationship between text unitsdparts of speech
such as nouns, verbs, and adjectivesdaddress
syntax primarily. One can extend grammars to
address natural-language semantics by greatly
expanding sub-categorization, with additional
rules/constraints (eg, ‘eat’ applies only to ingestible-item nouns). Unfortunately, the rules may
now become unmanageably numerous, often
interacting unpredictably, with more frequent
ambiguous parses (multiple interpretations of
a word sequence are possible). (Punsdambiguous parses used for humorous effectdantedate
NLP.)
< Handwritten rules handle ‘ungrammatical’
spoken prose and (in medical contexts) the
highly telegraphic prose of in-hospital progress
notes very poorly, although such prose is
human-comprehensible.

ABSTRACT
Objectives To provide an overview and tutorial of natural
language processing (NLP) and modern NLP-system
design.
Target audience This tutorial targets the medical
informatics generalist who has limited acquaintance with
the principles behind NLP and/or limited knowledge of
the current state of the art.
Scope We describe the historical evolution of NLP, and
summarize common NLP sub-problems in this extensive
field. We then provide a synopsis of selected highlights
of medical NLP efforts. After providing a brief description
of common machine-learning approaches that are being
used for diverse NLP sub-problems, we discuss how
modern NLP architectures are designed, with a summary
of the Apache Foundation’s Unstructured Information
Management Architecture. We finally consider possible
future directions for NLP, and reflect on the possible
impact of IBM Watson on the medical field.

NLP SUB-PROBLEMS: APPLICATION TO CLINICAL TEXT
We enumerate common sub-problems in NLP: Jurafksy and
Martin’s text20 provides additional details. The solutions to
some sub-problems have become workable and affordable, if
imperfectdfor example, speech synthesis (desktop operating
systems’ accessibility features) and connected-speech recognition
(several commercial systems). Others, such as question answering,
remain difﬁcult.
In the account below, we mention clinical-context issues that
complicate certain sub-problems, citing recent biomedical NLP
work against each where appropriate. (We do not cover the
history of medical NLP, which has been applied rather than
basic/theoretical; Spyns21 reviews pre-1996 medical NLP efforts.)
Low-level NLP tasks include:
1. Sentence boundary detection: abbreviations and titles (‘m.g.,’
‘Dr.’) complicate this task, as do items in a list or templated
utterances (eg, ‘MI [x], SOB[]’).
2. Tokenization: identifying individual tokens (word, punctuation) within a sentence. A lexer plays a core role for this task
and the previous one. In biomedical text, tokens often
contain characters typically used as token boundaries, for
example, hyphens, forward slashes (‘10 mg/day,’ ‘N-acetylcysteine’).
3. Part-of-speech assignment to individual words (‘POS tagging’): in
English, homographs (‘set’) and gerunds (verbs ending in ‘ing’
that are used as nouns) complicate this task.
4. Morphological decomposition of compound words: many
medical terms, for example, ‘nasogastric,’ need decomposition
J Am Med Inform Assoc 2011;18:544e551. doi:10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000464

to comprehend them. A useful sub-task is lemmatizationdconversion of a word to a root by removing sufﬁxes.
Non-English clinical NLP emphasizes decomposition; in
highly synthetic languages (eg, German, Hungarian), newly
coined compound words may replace entire phrases.22 Spellchecking applications and preparation of text for indexing/
searching (in IR) also employ morphological analysis.
5. Shallow parsing (chunking): identifying phrases from constituent part-of-speech tagged tokens. For example, a noun
phrase may comprise an adjective sequence followed by
a noun.
6. Problem-speciﬁc segmentation: segmenting text into meaningful
groups, such as sections, including Chief Complaint, Past
Medical History, HEENT, etc.23
Haas24 lists publicly available NLP modules for such tasks:
most modules, with the exception of cTAKES (clinical Text
Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System),25 have been
developed for non-clinical text and often work less well for
clinical narrative.
Higher-level tasks build on low-level tasks and are usually
problem-speciﬁc. They include:
1. Spelling/grammatical error identiﬁcation and recovery: this task is
mostly interactive because, as word-processing users know, it is
far from perfect. Highly synthetic phrases predispose to false
positives (correct words ﬂagged as errors), and incorrectly used
homophones (identically sounding, differently spelled words, eg,
sole/soul, their/there) to false negatives.
2. Named entity recognition (NER)26 27: identifying speciﬁc words
or phrases (‘entities’) and categorizing themdfor example, as
persons, locations, diseases, genes, or medication. An common
NER task is mapping named entities to concepts in a vocabulary. This
task often leverages shallow parsing for candidate entities (eg,
the noun phrase ‘chest tenderness’); however, sometimes the
concept is divided across multiple phrases (eg, ‘chest wall shows
slight tenderness on pressure .’).
The following issues make NER challenging:
< Word/phrase order variation: for example, perforated duodenal
ulcer versus duodenal ulcer, perforated.
< Derivation: for example, sufﬁxes transform one part of speech
to another (eg, ‘mediastinum’ (noun) / ‘mediastinal’
(adjective)).
< Inﬂection: for example, changes in number (eg, ‘opacity/
opacities)’, tense (eg, ‘cough(ed)’), comparative/superlative
forms (eg, ‘bigger/biggest)’).
< Synonymy is abundant in biomedicine, for example, liver/
hepatic, Addison’s disease/adrenocortical insufﬁciency.
< Homographs: polysemy refers to homographs with related
meanings, for example, ‘direct bilirubin’ can refer to
a substance, laboratory procedure, or result. Homographic
abbreviations are increasingly numerous28: ‘APC’ has 12
expansions, including ‘activated protein C’ and ‘adenomatous
polyposis coli.’
3. Word sense disambiguation (WSD)29e31: determining a homograph’s correct meaning.
4. Negation and uncertainty identiﬁcation32e34: inferring whether
a named entity is present or absent, and quantifying that
inference’s uncertainty. Around half of all symptoms, diagnoses,
and ﬁndings in clinical reports are estimated to be negated.35
Negation can be explicit, for example, ‘Patient denies chest pain’
or implieddfor example, ‘Lungs are clear upon auscultation’
implies absence of abnormal lung sounds. Negated/afﬁrmed
concepts can be expressed with uncertainty (‘hedging’), as in
‘the ill-deﬁned density suggests pneumonia.’ Uncertainty
that represents reasoning processes is hard to capture: ‘The

The 1980s resulted in a fundamental reorientation, summarized by Klein13:
< Simple, robust approximations replaced deep analysis.
< Evaluation became more rigorous.
< Machine-learning methods that used probabilities became
prominent. (Chomsky’s book, Syntactic Structures14 (1959),
had been skeptical about the usefulness of probabilistic
language models).
< Large, annotated bodies of text (corpora) were employed to
train machine-learning algorithmsdthe annotation contains
the correct answersdand provided gold standards for
evaluation.
This reorientation resulted in the birth of statistical NLP. For
example, statistical parsing addresses parsing-rule proliferation
through probabilistic CFGs15: individual rules have associated
probabilities, determined through machine-learning on annotated corpora. Thus, fewer, broader rules replace numerous
detailed rules, with statistical-frequency information looked up
to disambiguate. Other approaches build probabilistic ‘rules’
from annotated data similar to machine-learning algorithms like
C4.5,16 which build decision trees from feature-vector data. In
any case, a statistical parser determines the most likely parse of
a sentence/phrase. ‘Most likely’ is context-dependent: for
example, the Stanford Statistical Parser,17 trained with the Penn
TreeBank18dannotated Wall Street Journal articles, plus telephone-operator conversationsdmay be unreliable for clinical
text. Manning and Scheutze’s text provides an excellent introduction to statistical NLP.19
Statistical approaches give good results in practice simply
because, by learning with copious real data, they utilize the
most common cases: the more abundant and representative the
data, the better they get. They also degrade more gracefully with
unfamiliar/erroneous input. This issue’s articles make clear,
however, that handwritten-rule-based and statistical approaches
are complementary.

rounds, and the validation results are then averaged across
rounds.
Machine-learning models can be broadly classiﬁed as either
generative or discriminative. Generative methods seek to create
rich models of probability distributions, and are so called
because, with such models, one can ‘generate’ synthetic data.
Discriminative methods are more utilitarian, directly estimating
posterior probabilities based on observations. Srihari60 explains
the difference with an analogy: to identify an unknown
speaker’s language, generative approaches would apply deep
knowledge of numerous languages to perform the match;
discriminative methods would rely on a less knowledge-intensive approach of using differences between languages to ﬁnd the
closest match. Compared to generative models, which can
become intractable when many features are used, discriminative
models typically allow use of more features.61 Logistic regression
and conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) are examples of discriminative methods, while Naive Bayes classiﬁers and hidden
Markov models (HMMs) are examples of generative methods.
Some common machine-learning methods used in NLP tasks,
and utilized by several articles in this issue, are summarized
below.

Support vector machines (SVMs)
SVMs, a discriminative learning approach, classify inputs (eg,
words) into categories (eg, parts of speech) based on a feature
set. The input may be transformed mathematically using
a ‘kernel function’ to allow linear separation of the data points
from different categories. That is, in the simplest two-feature
case, a straight line would separate them in an XeY plot: in the
general N-feature case, the separator will be an (N1) hyperplane. The commonest kernel function used is a Gaussian
(the basis of the ‘normal distribution’ in statistics). The separation process selects a subset of the training data (the ‘support
vectors’ddata points closest to the hyperplane) that best
differentiates the categories. The separating hyperplane maximizes the distance to support vectors from each category
(see ﬁgure 1).

SOME DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES: AN OVERVIEW
Statistical and machine learning involve development (or use) of
algorithms that allow a program to infer patterns about example
(‘training’) data, that in turn allows it to ‘generalize’dmake
predictions about new data. During the learning phase, numerical parameters that characterize a given algorithm’s underlying
model are computed by optimizing a numerical measure,
typically through an iterative process.
In general, learning can be superviseddeach item in the
training data is labeled with the correct answerdor unsupervised,
where it is not, and the learning process tries to recognize
patterns automatically (as in cluster and factor analysis). One
pitfall in any learning approach is the potential for over-ﬁtting:
the model may ﬁt the example data almost perfectly, but makes
poor predictions for new, previously unseen cases. This is
because it may learn the random noise in the training data rather
than only its essential, desired features. Over-ﬁtting risk is
minimized by techniques such as cross-validation, which partition the example data randomly into training and test sets to
internally validate the model’s predictions. This process of data
partitioning, training, and validation is repeated over several
546

Figure 1 Support vector machines: a simple 2-D case is illustrated.
The data points, shown as categories A (circles) and B (diamonds), can
be separated by a straight line XeY. The algorithm that determines XeY
identifies the data points (‘support vectors’) from each category that are
closest to the other category (a1, a2, a3 and b1, b2, b3) and computes
XeY such that the margin that separates the categories on either side is
maximized. In the general N-dimensional case, the separator will be an
(N1) hyperplane, and the raw data will sometimes need to be
mathematically transformed so that linear separation is achievable.

patient probably has a left-sided cerebrovascular accident; postconvulsive state is less likely.’ Negation, uncertainty, and
afﬁrmation form a continuum. Uncertainty detection was the
focus of a recent NLP competition.36
5. Relationship extraction: determining relationships between
entities or events, such as ‘treats,’ ‘causes,’ and ‘occurs with.’
Lookup of problem-speciﬁc informationdfor example, thesauri,
databasesdfacilitates relationship extraction.
Anaphora reference resolution37 is a sub-task that determines
relationships between ‘hierarchically related’ entities: such relationships include:
< Identity: one entitydfor example, a pronoun like ‘s/he,’ ‘hers/
his,’ or an abbreviationdrefers to a previously mentioned
named entity;
< Part/whole: for example, city within state;
< Superset/subset: for example, antibiotic/penicillin.
6. Temporal inferences/relationship extraction38 39: making inferences from temporal expressions and temporal relationsdfor
example, inferring that something has occurred in the past or
may occur in the future, and ordering events within a narrative
(eg, medication X was prescribed after symptoms began).
7. Information extraction (IE): the identiﬁcation of problemspeciﬁc information and its transformation into (problemspeciﬁc) structured form. Tasks 1e6 are often part of the
larger IE task. For example, extracting a patient’s current
diagnoses involves NER, WSD, negation detection, temporal
inference, and anaphoric resolution. Numerous modern clinical
IE systems exist,40e44 with some available as open-source.25 44 45
IE and relationship extraction have been themes of several i2b2/
VA NLP challenges.46e49 Other problem areas include phenotype
characterization,50e52 biosurveillance,53 54 and adverse-drug
reaction recognition.55
The National Library of Medicine (NLM) provides several
well-known ‘knowledge infrastructure’ resources that apply to
multiple NLP and IR tasks. The UMLS Metathesaurus,56 which
records synonyms and categories of biomedical concepts from
numerous biomedical terminologies, is useful in clinical NER.
The NLM’s Specialist Lexicon57 is a database of common English
and medical terms that includes part-of-speech and inﬂection
data; it is accompanied by a set of NLP tools.58 The NLM also
provides a test collection for word disambiguation.59

Hidden Markov models (HMMs)

Conditional random fields (CRFs)

Figure 2 Hidden Markov models. The small circles S1, S2 and S3
represent states. Boxes O1 and O2 represent output values. (In practical
cases, hundreds of states/output values may occur.) The solid lines/arcs
connecting states represent state switches; the arrow represents the
switch’s direction. (A state may switch back to itself.) Each line/arc label
(not shown) is the switch probability, a decimal number. A dashed line/
arc connecting a state to an output value indicates ‘output probability’:
the probability of that output value being generated from the particular
state. If a particular switch/output probability is zero, the line/arc is not
drawn. The sum of the switch probabilities leaving a given state (and the
similar sum of output probabilities) is equal to 1. The sequential or
temporal aspect of an HMM is shown in figure 3.
J Am Med Inform Assoc 2011;18:544e551. doi:10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000464

CRFs are a family of discriminative models ﬁrst proposed by
Lafferty et al.73 An accessible reference is Culotta et al74; Sutton
and McCallum75 is more mathematical. The commonest (linearchain) CRFs resemble HMMs in that the next state depends on
the current state (hence the ‘linear chain’ of dependency).
CRFs generalize logistic regression to sequential data in the
same way that HMMs generalize Naive Bayes (see ﬁgure 3).
CRFs are used to predict the state variables (‘Ys’) based on the
observed variables (‘Xs’). For example, when applied to NER, the
state variables are the categories of the named entities: we want
to predict a sequence of named-entity categories within
a passage. The observed variables might be the word itself,
preﬁxes/sufﬁxes, capitalization, embedded numbers, hyphenation, and so on. The linear-chain paradigm ﬁts NER well: for
example, if the previous entity is ‘Salutation’ (eg, ‘Mr/Ms’), the
succeeding entity must be a person.
CRFs are better suited to sequential multivariate data than
HMMs: the training problem, while requiring more example
data than a univariate HMM, is still tractable.

N-grams
An ‘N-gram’19 is a sequence of N itemsdletters, words, or
phonemes. We know that certain item pairs (or triplets,
quadruplets, etc) are likely to occur much more frequently than
547

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/18/5/544/829676 by NIE user on 31 October 2020

An HMM is a system where a variable can switch (with varying
probabilities) between several states, generating one of several
possible output symbols with each switch (also with varying
probabilities). The sets of possible states and unique symbols
may be large, but ﬁnite and known (see ﬁgure 2). We can observe
the outputs, but the system’s internals (ie, state-switch probabilities and output probabilities) are ‘hidden.’ The problems to
be solved are:
A. Inference: given a particular sequence of output symbols,
compute the probabilities of one or more candidate stateswitch sequences.
B. Pattern matching: ﬁnd the state-switch sequence most likely to
have generated a particular output-symbol sequence.
C. Training: given examples of output-symbol sequence
(training) data, compute the state-switch/output probabilities (ie, system internals) that ﬁt this data best.
B and C are actually Naive Bayesian reasoning extended to
sequences; therefore, HMMs use a generative model. To solve
these problems, an HMM uses two simplifying assumptions
(which are true of numerous real-life phenomena):
1. The probability of switching to a new state (or back to the
same state) depends on the previous N states. In the simplest
‘ﬁrst-order’ case (N¼1), this probability is determined by the

current state alone. (First-order HMMs are thus useful to
model events whose likelihood depends on what happened
last.)
2. The probability of generating a particular output in
a particular state depends only on that state.
These assumptions allow the probability of a given stateswitch sequence (and a corresponding observed-output
sequence) to be computed by simple multiplication of the
individual probabilities. Several algorithms exist to solve these
problems.65 66 The highly efﬁcient Viterbi algorithm, which
addresses problem B, ﬁnds applications in signal processing, for
example, cell-phone technology.
Theoretically, HMMs could be extended to a multivariate
scenario,67 but the training problem can now become intractable. In practice, multiple-variable applications of HMMs (eg,
NER68) use single, artiﬁcial variables that are uniquely determined composites of existing categorical variables: such
approaches require much more training data.
HMMs are widely used for speech recognition, where
a spoken word’s waveform (the output sequence) is matched to
the sequence of individual phonemes (the ‘states’) that most
likely produced it. (Frederick Jelinek, a statistical-NLP advocate
who pioneered HMMs at IBM’s Speech Recognition Group,
reportedly joked, ‘every time a linguist leaves my group, the
speech recognizer’s performance improves.’20) HMMs also
address several bioinformatics problems, for example, multiple
sequence alignment69 and gene prediction.70 Eddy71 provides
a lucid bioinformatics-oriented introduction to HMMs, while
Rabiner72 (speech recognition) provides a more detailed introduction.
Commercial HMM-based speech-to-text is now robust
enough to have essentially killed off academic research efforts,
with dictation systems for specialized areasdeg, radiology and
pathologydproviding structured data entry. Phrase recognition
is paradoxically more reliable for polysyllabic medical terms than
for ordinary English: few word sequences sound like ‘angina
pectoris,’ while common English has numerous homophones
(eg, two/too/to).

others. For example, in English words, U always follows Q, and
an initial T is never followed by K (though it may be in
Ukrainian). In Portuguese, a Ç is always followed by a vowel
(except E and I). Given sufﬁcient data, we can compute
frequency-distribution data for all N-grams occurring in that
data. Because the permutations increase dramatically with
Ndfor example, English has 26^2 possible letter pairs, 26^3
triplets, and so ondN is restricted to a modest number. Google
has computed word N-gram data (N#5) from its web data and
from the Google Books project, and made it available freely.76
N-grams are a kind of multi-order Markov model: the probability of a particular item at the Nth position depends on the
previous N1 items, and can be computed from data. Once
computed, N-gram data can be used for several purposes:
< Suggested auto-completion of words and phrases to the user
during search, as seen in Google’s own interface.
< Spelling correction: a misspelled word in a phrase may be
ﬂagged and a correct spelling suggested based on the correctly
spelled neighboring words, as Google does.
< Speech recognition: homophones (‘two’ vs ‘too’) can be
disambiguated probabilistically based on correctly recognized
neighboring words.
< Word disambiguation: if we build ‘word-meaning’ N-grams
from an annotated corpus where homographs are tagged with
their correct meanings, we can use the non-ambiguous
neighboring words to guess the correct meaning of a homograph in a test document.
N-gram data are voluminousdGoogle’s N-gram database
requires 28 GBdbut this has become less of an issue as storage
becomes cheap. Special data structures, called N-gram indexes,
speed up search of such data. N-gram-based classiﬁers leverage
raw training text without explicit linguistic/domain knowledge;
while yielding good performance, they leave room for
improvement, and are therefore complemented with other
approaches.

Figure 4 A UIMA pipeline. An input task is sequentially put through
a series of tasks, with intermediate results at each step and final output at
the end. Generally, the output of a task is the input of its successor, but
exceptionally, a particular task may provide feedback to a previous one (as
in task 4 providing input to task 1). Intermediate results (eg, successive
transformations of the original bus) are read from/written to the CAS,
which contains metadata defining the formats of the data required at every
step, the intermediate results, and annotations that link to these results.

Figure 3 The relationship between Naive Bayes, logistic regression,
hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs).
Logistic regression is the discriminative-model counterpart of Naive
Bayes, which is a generative model. HMMs and CRFs extend Naive
Bayes and logistic regression, respectively, to sequential data (adapted
from Sutton and McCallum73). In the generative models, the arrows
indicate the direction of dependency. Thus, for the HMM, the state Y2
depends on the previous state Y1, while the output X1 depends on Y1.

Any practical NLP task must perform several sub-tasks. For
example, all of NLP sub-problems section9 s low-level tasks must
execute sequentially, before higher-level tasks can commence.
Since different algorithms may be used for a given task,
a modular, pipelined system designdthe output of one analytical
module becomes the input to the nextdallows ‘mixing-andmatching.’ Thus, a CRF-based POS tagger could be combined
with rule-based medical named-entity recognition. This design
improves system robustness: one could replace one module with
another (possibly superior) module, with minimal changes to
the rest of the system.
This is the intention behind pipelined NLP frameworks, such
as GATE77 and IBM (now Apache) Unstructured Information
Management Architecture (UIMA).78 UIMA’s scope goes beyond
NLP: one could integrate structured-format databases, images,
and multi-media, and any arbitrary technology. In UIMA, each
analytical task transforms (a copy of) its input by adding XMLbased markup and/or reading/writing external data. A task
operates on Common Analysis Structure (CAS), which contains
the data (possibly in multiple formats, eg, audio, HTML),
a schema describing the analysis structure (ie, the details of the
markup/external formats), the analysis results, and links
(indexes) to the portions of the source data that they refer to.
UIMA does not dictate the design of the analytical tasks
themselves: they interact with the UIMA pipeline only through
the CAS, and can be treated as black boxes: thus, different tasks
could be written in different programming languages.
The schema for a particular CAS is developer-deﬁned because
it is usually problem-speciﬁc. (Currently, no standard schemas
exist for tasks such as POS tagging, although this may change.)
Deﬁnition is performed using XMI (XML Metadata Interchange), the XML-interchange equivalent of the Uniﬁed
Modeling Language (UML). XMI, however, is ‘programmerhostile’: it is easier to use a commercial UML tool to design
a UML model visually and then generate XMI from it.79
In practice, a pure pipeline design may not be optimal for all
solutions. In many cases, a higher-level process needs to provide
feedback to a lower-level process to improve the latter’s accuracy. (All supervised machine- learning algorithms, for example,
ultimately rely on feedback.) Implementing feedback across
analytical tasks is complicated: it involves modifying the code of
communicating tasksdone outputting data that constitutes the
feedback, the other checking for the existence of such data, and
accepting them if available (see ﬁgure 4). New approaches based
on active learning may help select cases for manual labeling for
construction of training sets.80 81
Also, given that no NLP task achieves perfect accuracy, errors
in any one process in a pipeline will propagate to the next, and
so on, with accuracy degrading at each step. This problem,

Review
however, applies to NLP in general: it would occur even if the
individual tasks were all combined into a single body of code.
One way to address it (adopted in some commercial systems) is
to use alternative algorithms (in multiple or branching pipelines)
and contrast the ﬁnal results obtained. This allows tuning the
output to trade-offs (high precision versus high recall, etc).

A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE

IBM Watson: a wait-and-see viewpoint
Watson, which employs UIMA,82 is a system-engineering
triumph, using highly parallel hardware with 2880 CPUs+16 TB
RAM. All its lookup of reference content (encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc) and analytical operations use structures optimized for
in-memory manipulation. (By contrast, most pipelined NLP
architectures on ordinary hardware are disk-I/O-bound.) It integrates several software technologies: IR, NLP, parallel database
search, ontologies, and knowledge representation.
A Prolog parser extracts key elements such as the relationships
between entities and task-speciﬁc answers. In a recent public
display, the task was to compete for the fastest correct answer in
a series of questions against two human contestants in the
popular US-based television show, ‘Jeopardy.’ During training
with a Jeopardy question-databank, NLP is also used to preprocess online reference text (eg, encyclopedia, dictionaries) into
a structure that provides evidence for candidate answers,
including whether the relationships between entities in the
question match those in the evidence.83 The search, and ranking
of candidate answers, use IR approaches.
A challenge in porting Watson’s technology to other domains,
such as medical question answering, will be the degree to which
Watson’s design is generalizable.
< Watson built its lead in the contest with straightforward
direct questions whose answers many of the audience (and
the skilled human contestants) clearly knewdand which
a non-expert human armed with Google may have been able
to retrieve using keywords alone (albeit slower). As pointed
out by Libresco84 and Jennings,85 Watson was merely faster
with the buzzerdelectronics beats human reaction time. For
non-game-playing, real-world question answering scenarios,
however, split-second reaction time may not constitute
a competitive advantage.

Computing the correct response to the question about which
US city (Chicago) has two airports, one named after a World
War II battle (Midway), the other after a World War II hero
(O’Hare), involves three set intersections (eg, the ﬁrst
operation would cross names of airports in US cities against
a list of World War II battles). Watson lacked a higher-level
strategy to answer such complex questions.
< Watson’s Prolog parser and search, and especially the entire
reference content, were tuned/structured for playing Jeopardy, in which the questions and answers are one sentence
long (and the answer is of the form ‘what/who is/are X?’).
Such an approach runs the risk of ‘over-ﬁtting’ the system to
a particular problem, so that it may require signiﬁcant effort
to modify it for even a slightly different problem.
IBM recently conducted a medical diagnosis demonstration of
Watson, which is reported in an Associated Press article.86
Demonstrations eventually need to be followed by evaluations.
Earlier medical diagnosis advice software underwent evaluations
that were rigorous for their time, for example, Berner et al87 and
Friedman et al,88 and today’s evaluations would need to be even
more stringent. The articles from Miller and Masarie89 and
Miller90 are excellent starting points for learning about the
numerous pitfalls in the automated medical diagnosis domain,
and IBM may rediscover these:
< Medico-legal liability: ultimately the provider, not software, is
responsible for the patient.
< Reference-content reliability: determining the reliability of a given
unit of evidence is challenging. Even some recent recommendations by ‘authorities’ have become tainted (eg, in psychiatry)
with subsequent revelations of undisclosed conﬂict of interest.
< The limited role of NLP and unstructured text in medical diagnosis:
it is unclear that accurate medical diagnosis/advice mandates
front-end NLP technology: structured data entry with
thesaurus/N-gram assisted pick-lists or word/phrase completion might sufﬁce. Similarly, diagnostic systems have used
structured, curated information rather than unstructured
text for prioritizing diagnoses. Even this information requires
tailoring for local prevalence rates, and continual maintenance. Unstructured text, in the form of citations, is used
mainly to support the structured information.
To be fair to IBM, NLP technology may conceivably augment
web crawler technologies that search for speciﬁc information
and alert curators about new information that may require them
to update their database. Electronic IE technologies might save
curation time, but given the medico-legal consequences, and the
lack of 100% accuracy, such information would need to be
veriﬁed by humans.
From an optimistic perspective, the Watson phenomenon may
have the beneﬁcial side effect of focusing attention not only on
NLP, but also on the need to integrate it effectively with other
technologies.

Will NLP software become a commodity?
The post-Google interest in IR has led to IR commoditization:
a proliferation of IR tools and incorporation of IR technology
into relational database engines. Earlier, statistical packages and,
subsequently, data mining tools also became commoditized.
Commodity analytical software is characterized by:
< Availability of several tools within a package: the user can
often set up a pipeline without programming using a graphical metaphor.
< High user friendliness and ease of learning: online documentation/tutorials are highly approachable for the non-specialist,

Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (eg, computer chess)
have shown that effective approaches utilize the strengths of
electronic circuitrydhigh speed and large memory/disk capacity,
problem-speciﬁc data-compression techniques and evaluation
functions, highly efﬁcient searchdrather than trying to mimic
human neural function. Similarly, statistical-NLP methods
correspond minimally to human thought processes.
By comparison with IR, we now consider what it may take
for multi-purpose NLP technology to become mainstream.
While always important to library science, IR achieved major
prominence with the web, notably after Google’s scientiﬁc and
ﬁnancial success: the limelight also caused a corresponding IR
research and toolset boom. The question is whether NLP has
a similar breakthrough application in the wings. One candidate
is IBM Watson, which attracted much attention within the
biomedical informatics community (eg, the ACMI Discussion
newsgroup and the AMIA NLP working group discussion list)
after its ‘Jeopardy’ performance. Watson appears to address the
admittedly hard problem of question-answering successfully.
Although the Watson effort is impressive in many ways, its
discernible limitations highlight ongoing NLP challenges.

< For harder questions, Watson’s limitations became clearer.

focusing on when and how to use a particular tool rather than
its underlying mathematical principles.
< High value in relation to price: some offerings may even be
freeware.
By contrast, NLP toolkits and UIMA are still oriented toward
the advanced programmer, and commercial offerings are expensive. General purpose NLP is possibly overdue for commoditization: if this happens, best-of-breed solutions are more likely to rise
to the top. Again, analytics vendors are likely to lead the way,
following the steps of biomedical informatics researchers to devise
innovative solutions to the challenge of processing complex
biomedical language in the diverse settings where it is employed.
