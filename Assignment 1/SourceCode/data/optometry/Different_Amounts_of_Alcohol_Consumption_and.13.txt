ABSTRACT
Purpose. To evaluate the association between different amounts of alcohol consumption and the risk of age-related cataract.
Methods. We searched PubMed and Embase from their inception until May 2014 for case-control or cohort studies with
data on alcohol consumption and age-related cataract. Heavy alcohol consumption was defined as more than two
standard drinks per day, which is equal to a daily intake of 20 g of alcohol or 140 g per week. Moderate consumption was
defined as less than 20 g of alcohol per day but more than never any. We performed separate meta-analyses for
the associations of moderate or heavy alcohol consumption with age-related cataract under a random-effects model,
respectively.
Results. Five case-control and five cohort studies were identified through comprehensive literature search. In the metaanalysis of 10 studies, the associations between moderate alcohol consumption and age-related cataract were marginally
nonsignificant (pooled relative risk, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.05; I2 = 82.1%), whereas heavy alcohol
consumption was associated with an increased risk of age-related cataract (pooled relative risk, 1.26; 95% confidence
interval, 1.06 to 1.50; I2 = 58.9%). The association between heavy alcohol consumption and cataract was stronger in casecontrol than in cohort studies. Adjusting for smoking as a potential confounder attenuated the association between heavy
alcohol consumption and cataract.
Conclusions. Heavy alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of age-related cataract, whereas moderate
consumption may be protective for this ocular condition. Clinically, information on a patient’s alcohol drinking history
might be valuable to general physicians and ophthalmologists when there is a diagnosis of age-related cataract and should
be collected on a routine basis in eye clinics.

ge-related cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide.1Y8 With longer life expectancies and an
aging population throughout the world, the burden and
impact of age-related cataract tend to increase, resulting in a global
public health concern. The key step for the prevention of agerelated cataract is to identify the risk factors for this eye condition, especially modifiable ones. Up until now, few risk factors
have been consistently associated with age-related cataract except

smoking9 and ultraviolet exposure.10 In a recently published metaanalysis, we found that obesity increased the risks of age-related
cataract.11
Alcohol consumption is a common modifiable lifestyle factor
and appears to be associated with a wide range of chronic diseases
such as cancers,12 type 2 diabetes mellitus,13 and cardiovascular
diseases.14 However, there is uncertainty regarding its association
with age-related cataract in elderly adults. A relationship between
alcohol consumption and an increased risk of cataract has been
reported from cross-sectional studies,15,16 but several prospective
cohort studies have not found this association.17,18
It is especially important to understand whether the association
between alcohol consumption and age-related cataract is modified
by the amount of alcohol consumption because there is always a
U-shaped association observed in epidemiologic studies between
alcohol consumption and clinical disorders. For example, light
and moderate alcohol consumption appears to be protective for

cardiovascular diseases whereas heavy consumption appears to be a
risk factor.14 Therefore, a systematic approach to combine the
results of all available studies evaluating the association of alcohol
consumption with age-related cataract would be informative to
answer this research question. To address this gap, we conducted a
systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literatures to
examine if different amount of alcohol consumption is associated
with different risks of age-related cataract.

We assessed the study quality using the tool described by
Sanderson et al.20 The variables examined included the methods for
selecting study participants, methods for measuring exposure (alcohol consumption) and outcome variable (age-related cataract),
design-specific sources of bias (excluding confounding), methods
for controlling confounding, statistical methods (excluding control
of confounding), and conflict of interest.

Statistical Methods
METHODS
Search Strategy and Inclusion Criteria
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine
the association of alcohol consumption with age-related cataract
based on the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.19 We searched the electronic databases of PubMed
and Embase for relevant articles reporting the association published
up to May 2014 with the following search terms (formatted for
PubMed search): (‘‘ethanol’’[MeSH Terms] OR ‘‘ethanol’’[All
Fields] OR ‘‘alcohol’’[All Fields] OR ‘‘alcohols’’[MeSH Terms] OR
‘‘alcohols’’[All Fields]) AND ((‘‘cataract’[MeSH Terms] OR
‘‘cataract’’[All Fields]) OR (‘‘cataract’’[MeSH Terms] OR
‘‘cataract’’[All Fields] OR (‘‘lens’’[All Fields] AND ‘‘opacity’’[All
Fields]) OR ‘‘lens opacity’’[All Fields])). Titles and abstracts of the
studies were independently scanned by two authors (YG and KF).
Duplicate articles from the two databases were deleted. The
extracted studies were compared, and inconsistencies were resolved
by consensus. In addition, the reference lists of all identified studies
were examined. This study was approved by the Medical College of
Soochow University Institutional Review Board.
We included studies if they were case-control or cohort studies
and if they reported alcohol consumption as an exposure variable
and any subtypes of age-related cataract including cataract surgery as
the outcome measure. Furthermore, we included studies only if the
summary estimates such as odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs),
and hazard ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported
in the article or allowed for the calculation of the summary estimates
based on the data presented in the article. We only included studies
in which age-related cataract was assessed based on lens photographs
or diagnosed by ophthalmologists. We excluded studies if they were
not case-control or cohort studies (e.g., cross-sectional designs or
ecology studies) or if they measured cataract by questionnaires (selfreported). For cohort studies, if one study reported two results at
different follow-up periods, the result with a longer follow-up period
was included in the analysis. Although we did not specifically exclude non-English literature, the studies included in the final
analysis were all in English.

Data Extraction and Assessment of Study Quality
For each study in the analyses, we extracted the following information: first author, publication year, study name, study design, sample size, age range of the study participants, follow-up
periods (for cohort studies only), definitions of alcohol consumption and age-related cataract, summary estimates and corresponding 95% CI, and confounding factors adjusted for.

We performed the meta-analysis using Stata version 12.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX). We meta-analyzed the fully
adjusted, study-specific summary estimates using a random-effects
model to account for both within- and between-study variability.
Age-related cataract was treated as the outcome measure, whereas
alcohol consumption was analyzed as the independent variable.
Heavy alcohol consumption was defined as more than two standard drinks per day, which is equal to a daily intake of 20 g of
alcohol or 140 g per week. Moderate alcohol consumption was
defined as less than 20 g of alcohol per day but more than never.
We treated ‘‘nonYalcohol drinker’’ as the reference category and
converted summary estimates if necessary. Statistical heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using I2 statistic.21 Values of
0 to 24%, 25 to 49%, 50 to 74%, and more than 75% denote no,
low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.22 Sensitivity
analysis was performed to investigate the contribution of each
study to the heterogeneity by sequentially removing one study and
reanalyzing the pooled estimate for the remaining studies.
The RRs were used as the common measure of association
across studies. Hazard ratios were directly considered as RRs.
Where necessary, ORs were transformed into RRs with the following formula:

RR ¼ OR=½ð1jPo Þ þ ðPo  ORÞ;
in which Po is the rate of the outcome of interest in the
nonexposed group.14
The SE of the resulting converted RR was then determined with
the following formula:

SE logðRRÞ ¼ SE logðORÞ  logðRRÞ= logðORÞ:
In some studies, a single summary estimate was not available
for moderate/heavy drinkers versus nondrinkers because the data
were presented as only a dose-response. In these cases, we first
pooled across levels of alcohol intake within the study using a
random-effects model to derive a single summary estimate for
moderate/heavy drinkers versus nondrinkers. The resulting single,
study-specific summary estimate was then pooled with those of
other studies.
We evaluated publication bias using the Egger regression
asymmetry test and the Begg test. A two-sided p value of less than
0.05 was regarded as significant for all analyses.

RESULTS
We identified 1542 unique titles and abstracts in the electronic
databases of PubMed and Embase. After two rounds of reviews and
searching citations of retained articles, we identified 42 studies as
potentially relevant for analysis, from which we retrieved 29 full text

Questionnaire
At baseline examinations (1992Y1994), 3654 were
interviewed and examined. All surviving participants
were invited for reexamination after 5 y (1997Y1999)
and 10 y (2002Y2004), with 2335 (75.1% of survivors)
and 1952 (75.6% of survivors) returning for reexaminations
at these times, respectively.
Questionnaire
Between March 1987 and December 1990, all women born
between 1914 and 1948 living in the county of Uppsala
and all women born between 1917 and 1948 living in the
county of Västmanland received by mail a self-administered
questionnaire regarding information about diet, family history
of breast cancer, and some lifestylefactors together with an
invitation to participate in a mammography screening program.
In September 1997, an extended follow-up questionnaire was
mailed to 56,030 women remaining in the cohort after
exclusion of those who had died or permanently moved out
of the study areas.
Questionnaire
4926 persons participated in a baseline examination from March
1988 to September 1990. Of the 3334 surviving persons who
participated in a 5-y follow-up examination, 2764 (82.9%)
participated in the 10-y follow-up examination.
Questionnaire
The Nurses’ Health Study began in 1976 when 121,701, female
registered nurses aged 30Y55 y and residing in 11 states
returned a mailed questionnaire on medical history, use of oral
contraceptives, and risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular
disease. The follow-up rate for the cohort was 90.2% in 1992
as a percentage of total possible follow-up time.
Questionnaire
Participants in the Physicians’ Health Study, a randomized trial
of aspirin and beta-carotene among 22,071 male physicians
aged 40Y84 y at entry in 1982, were included in these analyses
if they did not report cataract at baseline and if they provided
information about alcohol consumption and other cataract risk
factors. A total of 17,824 physicians satisfied these criteria.

Italy.28 Of the 10 studies, 2 reported on all-female cohorts,17,24
1 reported on men only,25 and the other 7 included both men and
women. Two studies26,27 did not report the findings of moderate
alcohol consumption, whereas all identified studies reported the
associations between heavy alcohol consumption and cataract.
For the assessment of study quality, we examined the variables
included, methods for selecting study participants, methods for
measuring exposure (alcohol consumption) and outcome variable
(age-related cataract), design-specific sources of bias (excluding
confounding), methods for controlling confounding, statistical
methods (excluding control of confounding), and conflict of interest.
In general, all studies described sampling methods in the texts, albeit
in varying degrees. Six studies outlined specific exclusion criteria and
provided information on nonresponders. Among the five cohort
studies, three were population based and two were on specific working
groups. All the five case-control studies were clinically based. Data on
alcohol consumption were all self-reported and collected from
questionnaires whereas only two studies diagnosed cataract based on
lens photographs. In most of the included studies, cataract data were
retrieved by medical records or clinically diagnosed by ophthalmologists. Age and sex were adjusted in all included studies, whereas
smoking was adjusted in six studies. No studies reported conflict of
interest. The detailed assessment of study quality is shown in Table 2.

In the meta-analysis of 10 studies, the associations between
moderate alcohol consumption and age-related cataract were marginally nonsignificant (pooled RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.05; I2 =
82.1%) (Fig. 2), whereas heavy alcohol consumption was associated
with an increased risk of age-related cataract (pooled RR, 1.26; 95%
CI, 1.06 to 1.50; I2 = 58.9%) (Fig. 3).
Subgroup analyses were performed on study designs (cohort
studies vs. case-control studies) and confounders adjusted for (studies
adjusted for smoking vs. studies that did not adjust for smoking). The
association between heavy alcohol consumption and cataract was
stronger in case-control studies than in cohort studies. Adjusting for
smoking as a potential confounder attenuated the association between
heavy alcohol consumption and cataract. (Table 3).
Omission of individual studies revealed that no single study had
a particular influence on the pooled estimate. There was no evidence of publication bias as indicated by a nonsignificant Egger
test (all p 9 0.05) and Begg test (all p 9 0.05) in all analyses.

DISCUSSION
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that
heavy alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of agerelated cataract, whereas moderate alcohol consumption may be

protective for this ocular condition, although the finding was
marginally nonsignificant. Clinically, the findings indicated that information on a patient’s alcohol drinking history might be valuable to
general physicians and ophthalmologists when there is a diagnosis of
age-related cataract and should be collected on a routine basis in eye
clinics. Ophthalmologists should be aware that risk of age-related
cataract appears to vary by the amount of alcohol consumption.
Our study indicated that there may be a U-shaped association
between alcohol consumption and age-related cataract, which is
commonly observed in studies assessing the association between
alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases. These findings
may not be surprising as there are some shared risk factors between
age-related cataract and clinical cardiovascular diseases. A large
retrospective case-control study31 of adults older than 50 years
who underwent cataract surgery in Israel found that all risk factors
for cardiovascular diseases were significantly more prevalent in
cataract patients in univariate analysis. Meanwhile, multivariate
analysis also revealed a significant association of the exposures
related to cataractogenesis including diabetes, carotid artery disease, systemic arterial hypertension, peripheral vascular disease,
smoking, ischemic heart disease, chronic renal failure, hyperlipidemia, and Ashkenazi origin. In addition, the Blue Mountain Eye
Study found that baseline cardiovascular disease or vascular risk
factors such as obesity, hypertension, or angina were associated
with incident age-related cataract.32 Therefore, the effects of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular system and lens may share
common pathways in pathophysiology.
The biological plausibility behind the observed association has
not been elucidated, and we offer several possible explanations.
Oxidative stress is well known to be involved in the pathogenesis
of cataract.33 Heavy alcohol consumption could induce microsomal enzyme cytochrome CYP2E1 in the liver.34 Metabolism of
ethanol by cytochrome CYP2E1 could produce free radicals, which
may also lead to aggregation of lens proteins, leading to cataract
formation in elderly adults. Alternatively, maintenance of calcium
homeostasis is essential for normal functioning of the lens. Several
lens enzymes are calcium dependent and higher calcium levels are
shown to induce cataract in vitro, in both animal and human
studies.35 Acute alcohol exposure increases calcium permeability of
lens fiber cell membrane and inhibits calcium pumps on lens fiber
cells, resulting in higher intracellular lens calcium levels.36 This
disruption in calcium homeostasis may lead to cataract formation.
Despite a marginally nonsignificant association, our analysis revealed that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk for
age-related cataract. A population-based cohort study has shown
that light to moderate alcohol consumption could reduce the risk

2

of atherosclerosis of blood vessels.37 The protection afforded by
light to moderate alcohol consumption may possibly be attributed
to antithrombotic effects and inhibition of the atherogenic action of high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The atherosclerosis of local blood vessels may reduce the risk of cataract by
supplying the lens with more oxygen and nutrients.
We have noticed that smoking is a confirmed risk factor for agerelated cataract and the observed association between alcohol
consumption and age-related cataract may be confounded by
smoking status. The subgroup analysis in our study found that
pooling the studies that had adjusted for smoking as a potential
confounder attenuated the associations between alcohol consumption and age-related cataract but did not alter the trend.
Considering that there are only six studies that had adjusted for
smoking in this review, we cannot confirm whether smoking is a
confounder for the association between alcohol consumption and
age-related cataract. More well-designed cohort studies in nonsmokers are warranted to confirm if alcohol consumption is independently related to cataract.
During the peer-review process of this article, another metaanalysis on the association between alcohol intake and agerelated cataract was published by Wang and Zhang.38 However,
the hypotheses, methods for study selection, and statistical analyses between our study and theirs were completely different. First,
our hypothesis was that the risk of cataract is modified by the
amount of alcohol consumption whereas theirs was that the risk
of cataract differs between alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers.
Therefore, the main analyses as shown in the forest plots of the two
articles were completely different. In addition, some studies39,40
included in the article by Wang and Zhang were not included in
our analysis because these studies did not report the amountstratified analysis on the association between alcohol consumption
and cataract. Second, we included both case-control and cohort
studies whereas the article by Wang and Zhang only included cohort
studies. Although we acknowledge that cohort design provides
stronger evidence than case-control design, we think that it is important to include case-control studies in this meta-analysis, especially when the number of studies identified is small. Finally, we
believe that a stratified analysis for the studies that did and did not
adjust for smoking status should be performed on this research topic
because smoking is a well-established risk factor for age-related
cataract and is always associated with alcohol intake. Therefore,
smoking may be an important confounder for the association between alcohol intake and age-related cataract.
There are several strengths of the meta-analysis. From epidemiologic perspectives, only case-control or cohort studies were included,

which results in the analysis having a higher evidence level than those
including cross-sectional studies or ecologic studies. In addition, the
sample sizes of the included studies are large and the follow-up periods
of the cohort studies are relatively longer (at least 5 years). Limitations
of this meta-analysis should also be acknowledged. First, the potential
biases in the original studies, methodological issues, and different
strategies for adjusting for confounders could affect the results from
this meta-analysis. The observed association may have been confounded by other unadjusted factors or selection bias. Second, the
number of the contributing studies was small such that the results of
subgroups analysis may not be robust. Third, different studies
reported different outcomes of age-related cataract, which make it
impossible for us to perform subgroup analysis on different cataract
subtypes including nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataract. Finally, publication bias could be of concern because studies that
report statistically significant results are more likely to get published
than studies that report nonsignificant results, and this could have
distorted the findings of our meta-analyses. Although the Egger test
and the Begg test indicated little evidence of publication bias in this
meta-analysis, the estimation may not be accurate enough as the
number of the studies is small.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis of 10
epidemiologic studies demonstrated that effect of alcohol consumption on age-related cataract is not linear and varies by the
amount of alcohol consumption. Moderate consumption appears to
be protective for age-related cataract with marginally nonsignificant
association, whereas heavy alcohol consumption is a risk factor for
this eye condition. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that
lifestyle changes in alcohol intake would help alter the incidence and
associated costs of age-related cataract, subsequently changing visual
functioning and health-related quality of life.
