SIGNIFICANCE: Identification of the association of specific signs of dry eye disease with specific visual function
deficits may allow for more targeted approaches to treatment.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the association of dry eye signs and symptoms with visual
acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity in the Dry Eye Assessment and Management study.
METHODS: Baseline data from participants in the Dry Eye Assessment and Management study were used in this
secondary cross-sectional analysis. Standardized procedures were used to obtain results on the Ocular Surface
Disease Index (OSDI), high-contrast logMAR VA, contrast sensitivity, tear film debris, tear breakup time (TBUT),
corneal fluorescein staining, meibomian gland evaluation, conjunctival lissamine green staining, and Schirmer
test scores. Generalized linear models that included age, refractive error status, and cataract status were used
to assess the association between VA and contrast sensitivity with OSDI score and each dry eye sign. The Hochberg
procedure was used to account for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Among 487 participants (974 eyes), worse VA was associated with worse mean score on the OSDI
vision subscale (39.4 for VA 20/32 or worse vs. 32.4 for VA 20/16 or better; adjusted linear trend, P = .02);
scores were not associated with contrast sensitivity. Severe meibomian gland plugging and abnormal secretions
were associated with worse mean log contrast sensitivity (1.48 for severe vs. 1.54 for not plugged [P = .04] and
1.49 for obstructed vs. 1.57 for clear [P = .002], respectively). Longer TBUT was associated with better mean
log contrast sensitivity (1.57 for TBUT >5 seconds and 1.51 for TBUT ≤2 seconds, P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Worse VA rather than worse contrast sensitivity drives vision-related symptoms in dry eye. Greater
tear film instability was associated with worse contrast sensitivity.

Dry eye is a highly prevalent condition1–6 that significantly
affects quality of life2,7 and is additionally a major risk factor
for a variety of corneal and ocular surface morbidities such as
corneal infection,8,9 thinning,10,11 and contact lens intolerance.12
Disease definitions vary between studies, but studies that define
dry eye based on symptoms report a prevalence ranging from 6.5
to 52.4%, with the majority reporting a prevalence of around
20%.3 The prevalence of disease increases with age, and women
are more frequently affected.3 Dry eye not only results in decreased
quality of life but also can affect visual function. In a recent natural
history study of dry eye, blurred vision was reported as moderate
to very severe in 58% of dry eye patients compared with only
10.5% in healthy controls.13 Although there are many reports
of decreased visual quality of life and symptoms in dry eye patients compared with controls,2,7,12 there is little information

surrounding which specific dry eye signs contribute to diminished
visual function.
Previous studies have assessed corneal irregularity from superficial punctate keratitis and tear film instability in their relationship
to visual function. Central superficial punctate keratitis in dry eye
has been associated with significant deterioration of visual function
and optical quality measured by functional visual acuity measurements (time-wise change in continuous visual acuity14) and contrast
sensitivity.15–17 Ocular surface damage in the central cornea has
also been associated with increased higher-order aberrations and increased corneal backward light scatter.18 In addition, tear film instability has been associated with an irregular optical surface affecting
visual function. For example, temporal changes in higher-order
aberrations are associated with the tear film interface in dry eye.19
However, additional studies are needed to understand the relationship

between specific dry eye signs and the corresponding effects on
visual function, which in turn will aid clinicians in designing appropriate treatment plans for dry eye patients.
Various methods have been used to subjectively assess visual
function in dry eye disease including high- and low-contrast visual
acuity, dynamic visual acuity,14 contrast sensitivity,20 and disability
glare.15,20–22 Because standard high-contrast visual acuity is not
sensitive enough to detect mild ocular disease in other conditions
such as cataract and glaucoma and is known to be variable in dry
eye disease, other measures of visual function are needed. Contrast
sensitivity is a candidate because it is a sensitive indicator of visual
function and ocular disease progression.23–27 However, although
previous studies have shown that contrast sensitivity is a sensitive
measure of the effects of dry eye on visual function,15,17 very few
have assessed which particular clinical signs impact this measurement. To address this knowledge gap, we obtained data from the
Dry Eye Assessment and Management study that has a large, wellcharacterized cohort with dry eye disease, including information on
both the standardized assessment of logMAR visual acuity and
contrast sensitivity. In addition, because Sjögren syndrome patients were included in the study, this subset allowed for an assessment of the effect of aqueous deficiency on both measures. Herein,
we explore the association of dry eye signs and symptoms at
baseline with best-corrected high-contrast logMAR visual acuity and
contrast sensitivity.

the Ocular Surface Disease Index, participants completed the
Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (scores
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better healthrelated quality of life), although this was not part of the eligibility
assessment. Patients needed to have at least one eye with at least
two of the following four signs: conjunctival lissamine green staining score ≥1 on a scale of 0 to 6, corneal fluorescein staining
score ≥4 on a scale of 0 to 15, tear film breakup time ≤7 seconds,
and Schirmer test with anesthesia measurement ≥1 to ≤7 mm/
5 min at each of the screening and eligibility visits. Patients with
a history of Sjögren syndrome were included, as were patients with
thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory diseases if
they were otherwise eligible. Medications for dry eye or regular
use of systemic medications including those known to cause ocular
dryness was allowed if the patient committed to using them for
the next 12 months. However, those who wore contact lens
30 days before the screening visit were ineligible, as were those
who had a history of laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, ocular
infection, recent ocular surgery, or contraindications to high-dose
ω3 supplementation.

Visual Function Testing
Visual function testing was performed by a Dry Eye Assessment
and Management clinician or technician who had completed a

METHODS
The Dry Eye Assessment and Management study was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trial to evaluate the
effectiveness and safety of supplementation with ω3 fatty acids
in relieving the symptoms of moderate to severe dry eye disease.28
A total of 535 subjects across 27 sites in the United States were
enrolled and followed up for 12 months in the primary trial. Eligible
participants were randomized to receive either 3 g of fish-derived
ω3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids daily (n = 349)
or a placebo containing 5 g of refined olive oil (n = 186). Candidates for the clinical trial were assessed at a screening visit and
an eligibility confirmation visit, which together encompass the
baseline data used in this secondary cross-sectional analysis. The
study protocol was approved by the institutional review board associated with each center, carried out under an Investigational New
Drug application for the Food and Drug Administration, conformed
with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02128763). All subjects provided written
informed consent.

Subjects
The trial was designed to include a broad spectrum of symptomatic patients with moderate or severe dry eye. Eligibility criteria included age ≥18 years, dry eye–related ocular symptoms for at least
6 months, use or desire to use artificial tears on average of two more
times a day during the 2 weeks preceding the screening visit, and
scores on the Ocular Surface Disease Index between 25 and 80,
inclusive, at the screening visit and between 21 and 80, inclusive,
at the eligibility confirmation visit. Scores on the 12-item Ocular
Surface Disease Index range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no
ocular discomfort.29 Three subscales of the Ocular Surface Disease
Index (ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental
triggers) also provide scores between 0 and 100. In addition to

certification program. Visual acuity testing and contrast sensitivity
testing were performed with correction after manifest refraction
during the baseline visit. Monocular visual acuity testing was performed using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study
charts and technique at 3.2 m; different charts were used for the
right and left eyes. A light meter was used to ensure that the light
hitting the chart was 189 to 377 lux. The sum of the number of
letters read correctly on each line was recorded. A letter score of
85 corresponds to an approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/20.
Contrast sensitivity was measured with the Mars Letter Contrast
Sensitivity Test following the instructions provided from the manufacturer. Briefly, the chart was illuminated uniformly such that a
light meter measured 189 to 377 lux on the chart. Participants
wore the refractive correction determined by refraction with an
add of +2.00 diopters and an occluder or patch on the untested
eye. The participants' viewing distance to the chart was 50 cm
(20 inches). Different charts were used for the right and left eyes.
Each letter read on the chart was marked as correct or incorrect
until two consecutive letters were read incorrectly by the patient.
The number of letters read on the Mars Contrast Sensitivity Chart
was converted to a log contrast sensitivity value where one additional letter was associated with an increase of 0.04 units.

A Dry Eye Assessment and Management clinician who completed a certification program for clinical assessment and grading
examined each eye and performed an external examination and
biomicroscopy with a slit lamp. Tear film debris was graded for
each eye as none, mild (present in the inferior tear meniscus), moderate (present in the inferior tear meniscus and in the tear film overlying the cornea), and severe (present in the inferior tear meniscus
and in the tear film overlying the cornea or presence of mucus
strands in the inferior fornix or on the bulbar conjunctiva). At separate time points, 2% fluorescein dye and 1% lissamine green dye
were instilled by placing a small pool of dye into a sterile container
using an Eppendorf micropipette and a tip to draw up 5 μL of dye
and placing the volume into the inferior cul-de-sac. After instillation
of fluorescein dye in the right eye, assessment of tear breakup time
was followed sequentially by assessment of corneal fluorescein
staining and meibomian gland evaluation, and after instillation of
lissamine green, staining evaluation of the interpalpebral conjunctiva was conducted; the sequence of testing was repeated for the left
eye. Intraocular pressure was measured for each eye, and Schirmer
test was administered to each eye simultaneously.
Measurement of fluorescein tear breakup time began approximately 30 seconds after instillation of fluorescein dye. The clinician viewed the cornea through a slit lamp using broad-beam
cobalt blue illumination and a yellow barrier filter. The clinician
instructed the patient to blink and measured the time to the first

discontinuity in the tear film with a stopwatch. The measurement
was repeated two more times. The average of the three measurements of tear breakup time per eye was used for analysis. The central
five meibomian glands of the lower lid were assessed after application of pressure to the lower eyelid below the lashes using the
Meibomian Gland Evaluator (Johnson & Johnson [previously Tear
Science], Jacksonville, FL). The number of plugged glands was
counted, and secretions were graded as clear liquid oil, mild haze/
cloudy liquid, paste (toothpaste consistency), or obstructed (no
secretion, including capped orifices). Assessment of corneal
staining under the same viewing conditions as those for tear
breakup time began approximately 2 to 3 minutes after the fluorescein dye instillation. The staining of the central cornea and
four surrounding sectors was each scored from 0 (no staining)
to 3 (dense staining). The central cornea was defined as a circular area
encompassing approximately one-fifth of the corneal surface with superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal quadrants extending from the central circular zone to the periphery of the cornea, each encompassing
another one-fifth of the corneal surface. Grading of conjunctival staining began 1 to 2 minutes after instillation of lissamine green dye. The
clinician viewed the temporal and nasal conjunctiva through a slit
lamp using white light and graded punctate staining from 0 (no staining) to 3 in each area. The sum of the scores from all sectors per eye
was used for corneal and conjunctival staining; in addition, only the
central corneal staining score was assessed for association with visual
acuity and contrast sensitivity. Approximately 5 minutes after instillation of a topical anesthetic, Schirmer test strips were hung onto the
lower conjunctival sac in the temporal one-third of the eyelid.
The patient was instructed to close both eyes. After 5 minutes, as
measured by a stopwatch, the strips were removed, and the length
of wetting of the strip was recorded in millimeters.

Statistical Analysis
Participants were excluded from analysis if their visual acuity
scores in at least one eye were worse than 0.44 logMAR (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/50) or if there was a history of

diabetic retinopathy in one or both eyes because ocular pathology
other than dry eye would be more likely to be responsible for their
decreased vision. We performed descriptive analyses using mean
(standard deviation) for continuous measures and percentages for
categorical measures. Baseline values for the Ocular Surface Disease Index were the average of the values from the screening and
eligibility confirmation visits.
We used the generalized linear model to assess the association
between visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with each of the dry
eye symptom measurements (Ocular Surface Disease Index total
score, vision-related subscale score of the Ocular Surface Disease
Index, and Short Form-36 score). In these analyses, visual acuity
or contrast sensitivity was modeled as an independent variable,
and each dry eye symptom score was modeled as a dependent variable, to determine whether subjects with worse vision reported
more symptoms. Because the dry eye symptom measure is person
specific, the visual acuity or contrast sensitivity was based on the
better eye of this specific measurement. To help with the clinical
interpretation and to avoid the strong assumption of linear association, the continuous measures (when modeled as independent variables) were categorized into severity levels, and a linear trend
P value was used to test the association.
We used the generalized linear models to evaluate the associations between each dry eye sign with visual acuity and with contrast
sensitivity. In these models, each dry eye sign was modeled as an
independent variable, and visual acuity or contrast sensitivity was
modeled as the dependent variable, to determine whether eyes
with more severe signs had worse visual acuity scores or contrast
sensitivity. Because measures of dry eye signs, visual acuity, and
contrast sensitivity are all eye specific, these analyses were performed at the eye level, and their intereye correlation was accounted
for by using generalized estimating equations.
Because these associations may differ by the status of Sjögren
syndrome, we tested the interaction of Sjögren syndrome status
with each independent variable. When a statistically significant interaction was found, analyses stratified by Sjögren syndrome status
were performed. Dry Eye Assessment and Management patients

were classified as having Sjögren syndrome if an antibody profile
met the 2012 American College of Rheumatology criteria and
had a sum of the Dry Eye Assessment and Management corneal
and conjunctival staining scores of ≥3.
All these statistical models included adjustment of pre-selected
covariates (age, refractive error, and status of cataract). All statistical analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC). To account for the multiple comparisons from analyzing the
association of multiple factors with dry eye symptoms and from
analyzing multiple dry eyes signs as predictors for visual acuity
and contrast sensitivity, we calculated adjusted P value using
the Hochberg procedure.30 Adjusted P values of <.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Characteristics of Analysis Cohort
Among 535 Dry Eye Assessment and Management participants,
487 participants (974 eyes) were eligible for the analysis after excluding participants with visual acuity 20/50 or worse in at least
one eye (n = 45 participants), without visual acuity (n = 1 participant), or with diabetic retinopathy (n = 2 participants; Fig. 1).
Among these remaining 487 eligible subjects, 61 had no Sjögren
syndrome tests or indeterminate Sjögren syndrome status, leaving
45 subjects who had Sjögren syndrome at baseline and 381 subjects
without Sjögren syndrome.
The participant and ocular characteristics of the 487 participants
are displayed in Table 1. The mean (standard deviation) age was 58
(13) years, 81% were female, 74% were white, 13% were black, and
13% were Hispanic. The mean (standard deviation) Ocular Surface
Disease Index scores were 42 (16) for the total and 35 (19) for the

vision-related subscale. The mean Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item
Short Form Health Survey scores were 48 (9.7) for physical health
and 52 (9.4) for mental health. The mean (standard deviation)
scores of dry eye signs for the cohort are displayed in Table 1.

Association of Visual Acuity and Contrast Sensitivity
with Dry Eye Symptoms
In adjusted analyses (adjusted for age, refractive error, and status of cataract), poorer visual acuity was significantly associated
with worse mean Ocular Surface Disease Index vision-related subscale score (adjusted means, 39.4 for visual acuity 20/32 or worse
and 32.4 for visual acuity 20/16 or better; adjusted linear trend,
P = .02). However, visual acuity was not significantly associated
with the mean Ocular Surface Disease Index total score or the
mean Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
scores (Table 2).
Contrast sensitivity was not significantly associated with mean
Ocular Surface Disease Index scores and mean Medical Outcomes
Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores (Table 2). There
were no significant interactions between Sjögren syndrome and
visual acuity or contrast sensitivity on the association with dry
eye symptoms (all, P ≥ .21).

Association between Dry Eye Signs and Visual Acuity
The results of the adjusted analysis (adjusted for age, refractive
error, and status of cataract) for associations between dry eye signs
and visual acuity are shown in Table 3. Measures of tear film disruption, including tear film debris and tear breakup time, were
not associated with worse mean visual acuity. Counterintuitively,
increased tear film debris was significantly associated with better
visual acuity score (adjusted mean visual acuity scores, 83.5

letters for moderate tear film debris and 81.5 letters for none; linear trend adjusted, P = .02), and longer tear breakup time was
significantly associated with worse visual acuity score (adjusted
mean visual acuity scores, 79.7 letters for tear breakup time
>5 seconds and 82.7 letters for tear breakup time ≤2 seconds;
linear trend, P < .0001; Fig. 2). When the tear film debris and
tear breakup time were considered together in a multivariate
model that was adjusted for age, refractive error status, and cataract status, their association with visual acuity remained statistically significant for both tear film debris (P = .004) and tear
breakup time (P = .0009; Table 4). Signs of meibomian gland dysfunction (plugged glands and cloudy secretions), conjunctival staining, and Schirmer test scores were not significantly associated with
visual acuity (all linear trends, P > .64; Table 3).
There was a statistically significant interaction between the
presence of Sjögren syndrome and tear film debris (adjusted,
P = .02) for the association with visual acuity. In an analysis stratified by Sjögren syndrome status (Appendix Table A1, available at
http://links.lww.com/OPX/A404), the mean visual acuity score significantly increased with severity of tear film debris (adjusted linear
trend, P = .001) in non–Sjögren syndrome patients; however, in
Sjögren syndrome patients, the mean visual acuity scores did not
show an association with tear film severity (linear trend, P = .07).

plugging was significantly associated with worse mean log contrast
sensitivity in both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjusted
mean log contrast sensitivity score, 1.48 for severe vs. 1.54 for
none plugged; linear trend adjusted, P = .04). Similarly, the degree
of abnormality in meibomian gland secretions was significantly associated with worse mean log contrast sensitivity (adjusted mean
log contrast sensitivity scores, 1.49 for obstructed and 1.57 for
clear; linear trend adjusted, P = .002). Longer tear breakup time
was significantly associated with better mean log contrast sensitivity (adjusted log contrast sensitivity scores, 1.57 for tear breakup
time >5 seconds and 1.51 for tear breakup time ≤2 seconds; linear
trend adjusted, P = .02). When meibomian gland plugging and tear
breakup time were considered together in a multivariate model that
was adjusted for age, refractive error status, and cataract status,
the significant association with contrast sensitivity remained for
meibomian gland plugging (P = .01) and tear breakup time
(P = .009; Table 4, Fig. 3). Tear film debris, conjunctival staining,
corneal staining, and Schirmer test score were not significantly associated with contrast sensitivity (all linear trend adjusted,
P ≥ .55, Table 4).

Associations between Dry Eye Signs with
Contrast Sensitivity

Dry eye has a deleterious effect on multiple aspects of visual
function despite normal visual acuity being documented using
standard testing techniques.31 Our data substantiate the finding
that, even among patients with relatively good visual acuity (20/50

or better), worse visual acuity corresponded to worse scores on the
Ocular Surface Disease Index vision-related symptoms subscale in
dry eye patients. However, none of the dry eye signs we measured
in the study deleteriously impacted visual acuity. Although subtle
visual acuity changes could be documented based on differences
in tear film debris and tear breakup time, the mean changes were
small (approximately two letters) and not in the direction one would
expect. Alternatively, we found that contrast sensitivity measurements were more sensitive to differences based on dry eye signs related to tear film stability (tear breakup time and meibomian gland
dysfunction) than conventional visual acuity assessments.
We included evaluation of central corneal fluorescein staining
on vision in the Dry Eye Assessment and Management participants,
as this has been shown to decrease quality of life in other ocular
surface disease patients and central corneal staining directly impacted functional, dynamic visual acuity in a small dry eye study
of 22 patients.15,32 In addition, Huang and colleagues15 previously
found that, in dry eye patients with punctate epithelial keratopathy,
contrast sensitivity improved after instillation of artificial tears.
However, we were not able to demonstrate an impact on highcontrast visual acuity or contrast sensitivity with increased central
corneal staining in our dry eye cohort. The Dry Eye Assessment
and Management cohort had relatively low corneal staining scores
overall (mean staining score, 3.6 of 15; Table 1), and we used
static measures of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity rather than
dynamic, which may account for the differences in our findings compared with others.
Using low-contrast optotypes, the measurement of contrast
sensitivity can detect subtle vision changes that may not be detected
with standard visual acuity testing. In our study, we detected a
~0.07 difference in log contrast sensitivity in eyes with severe

meibomian gland dysfunction or obstructed meibomian gland secretions compared with normal eyes and in eyes with short (≤2 seconds)
tear breakup time compared with eyes with longer (>5 seconds)
times. In other ocular diseases such as glaucoma and age-related
macular degeneration, standard high-contrast visual acuity testing
did not differentiate between milder ocular disease states when
contrast sensitivity did.23–27 For example, in patients with different
stages of glaucoma, mean log contrast sensitivity differed significantly between patients with early and moderate visual field defects (1.76 vs. 1.51, respectively).33 In another study, the mean
log contrast sensitivity was 1.62 for healthy subjects aged 22 to
77 years, with significantly lower values in patients with glaucoma
(1.56) or age-related macular degeneration (1.03).34 In addition,
in a study evaluating visual function in recalcitrant neovascular
age-related macular degeneration after switching anti–vascular
endothelial growth factor treatments, mean log contrast sensitivity improved from 1.32 to 1.40 units, whereas visual acuity remained
stable throughout.35
The findings of improved visual acuity with worse tear film
debris and shorter breakup time were unexpected and counterintuitive. These patients may be compensating by blinking more
to distribute the tear film and remove debris that could contribute
to improved vision. Evaluating only the Sjögren syndrome group
can provide us an indication of the impact of aqueous deficiency
on these associations. When we scrutinized only the Sjögren
syndrome group, we found no impact of any ocular signs on highcontrast visual acuity. That is, the previous associations and trends
of tear film debris and tear breakup time on visual acuity as noted
in the entire cohort were not present in the Sjögren syndrome
group, suggesting that aqueous deficiency does not contribute to
these relationships.

Limitations of our study and analyses include having patients
with a limited range of symptoms because patients with mild or
very severe symptoms as measured by the Ocular Surface Disease Index were excluded. Also, as in most research studies,
visual function was measured as a patient read a chart in an
examination room where blinking may differ from other everyday activities such as viewing a display screen or reading
printed material.

In conclusion, our study found that poorer visual acuity rather
than worse contrast sensitivity drives visual symptoms and complaints in dry eye. However, contrast sensitivity measurements are
more sensitive to worse tear film stability measures (such as tear
breakup time and Meibomian gland plugging) than standard visual
acuity assessments. Future studies that examine how specific ocular
signs affect various measures of visual function would be helpful in
elucidating these relationships and could in turn guide therapies.
