Scientiﬁc bibliometrics or ‘‘Scientometrics’’ are increasingly used to evaluate the impact of scientiﬁc publication.
Most of them rank the scientiﬁc work visibility for individuals, journals or institutions based on different algorithms
that generally compute the number of citations received by
the publications. They have a signiﬁcant effect on the public
and peers perception of scientiﬁc merit for authors, journals
and institutions.
Not dismissing the limitations of those metrics, which
have been object of previous publications1,2 they provide
an objective methodology to evaluate the impact of the
research published. Other applications of bibliometrics aim
to identify the interaction between researchers in different
ﬁelds highlighting the predominant authors or the countries
where such research is conducted.3---7 One of the most traditionally used metrics is the Impact Factor (IF) published
every year by Clarivate Analytics in the Web of Science.8 This
index ranks the journals according to the number of citations
received over the previous two years. So, the IF uses a simple algorithm resulting from a quotient between citations
received (numerator) and articles published (denominator)
over the 2 year period.
Journal of Optometry has evolved signiﬁcantly in the
number of manuscripts submitted for publication as well as
in the number of citations collected from other publications.
Figure 1 shows a picture of other rankings for Journal
of Optometry as obtained on March 22nd , 2020. Notably, J
Optom SJR has increased steadily over the last 4 years. Out
of the 10 indexed journals in its category, J Optom ranks

3rd along with the other two main journals Optometry and
Vision Science (OVS) published by the American Academy of
Optometry and Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics (OPO)
published by the British College of Optometrists. J Optom
is also the only one that provides Open Access to readers,
being also free for authors publishing in the journal.
Consequently, metrics calculated by different platforms
has increased steadily over the past years. All the estimated
metrics have increased consistently over the last years.
(Figure 1). Clarivate IF metric is not available as J Optom is
not indexed in that database. Lower absolute values of SJR
and SNIP (see ﬁgure caption for deﬁnitions) should not surprise the reader as they result from the calculation method
and this behavior is also common to other journals in the
ﬁeld. A summarized view of relevant aspects and calculation

methods of the different metrics introduced in this editorial
is are summarized in Table 1.
One of those important metrics adopted by several academic institutions around the world has been delivered
by SCImago. According to Scimago ranking, the Journal of
Optometry ended the year 2018 in the 1st quartile (3rd in the
ranking) in the section of Health Professions (Optometry)
along with other 9 publications.9 SCImago Journal Ranking
(SJR) index is a metric based on the idea that not all citations
are the same. SJR uses a similar algorithm as the Google page
rank; it provides a quantitative and qualitative measure of
the journal’s impact. In the words of SCImago ‘‘SJR is a measure of scientiﬁc inﬂuence of journals that accounts for both
the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations are
originated. It measures the scientiﬁc inﬂuence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global
scientiﬁc discussion an average article of the journal is’’.
The H-index, after Argentinean-American Professor Jorge
E. Hirsch is another metric that now has been extended to
rank not only individuals but also institutions and journals.10
H-index represents the number of publications by a given
author, journal or institution being cited equal or superior
number of times. Despite its merits in differentiating highly
cited publications, this metric tends to favor the older publications compared to the new publications as well as older

authors compared to youngest that had less time to accumulate citations. As an example, J Optom ranks 6th in the SJR
instead of 3rd , when ordered by H-index which is perfectly
understandable as the ﬁrst 4 ranked are covered from the
1980’s for the calculation of this index compared to 2007
for the 5th ranked journal and third semester of 2008 for J
Optom.
Another emerging index is the Scopus CiteScoreTM that
measures average citations received per document published. In its 2018 metrics covering citations during 2015,
2016 and 2017, J Optom ranks 3rd among the 14 journals
indexed in the Optometry ﬁeld. As stated in CiteScore webpage, all types of documents (research articles, review
articles, conference proceedings, editorials errata, letters,
notes, and short surveys) are included in the CiteScore calculation. Although articles in press are included in Scopus
they are not included in the CiteScore calculation.11
No single metric is perfect and one of the ﬂaws pointed
is that comparing journals or authors in different ﬁelds
is difﬁcult because of the asymmetry between the scientiﬁc activity. For example, comparing Cancer research ﬁeld
where thousands of articles are published covering a very
large scope of biological, pharmaceutical, medical specialties among many others and being potentially cited by all of
them, with other sub-specialties as Ophthalmology, Optometry, etc, is not possible. To avoid this, some metrics such

as the Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) developed by Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)
of Leiden University weights citations based on the total
number of citations in a subject ﬁeld.12 As stated elsewhere
‘‘compares each journal’s citations per publication with the
citation potential of its ﬁeld, deﬁned as the set of publications citing that journal’’. A synthesis of this and other
citation metrics can be found elsewhere.13,14
It has to be highlighted that all metrics have about 1 to 2
years of delay as the metrics usually available have been calculated considering the citations in papers published 2 years
before the yearly metric release. This is the only way to capture virtually all the citations obtained by a given article,
author, journal or institution.
As authors, reviewers, professionals and students recognize the value of Journal of Optometry in dissemination of
the knowledge this has been followed by prestige databases
as recognition of Pubmed, Scopus, SCIMago, SNIP, CiteScore,
just to mention some of the most widely adopted. Noteworthy, the metrics achieved by J Optom are even more
remarkable considering that its level of autocitation is
among the lowest, under 10% of all the cites collected
between 2015 and 2019. Journal of Optometry is certainly a
fully consolidated and respected journal in the ﬁeld and it
is our responsibility to keep this track record to strength the
publication capability of the optometry and vision science
ﬁeld to contribute to the advance of scientiﬁc knowledge
and provide wider and better eyecare to populations Worldwide.
