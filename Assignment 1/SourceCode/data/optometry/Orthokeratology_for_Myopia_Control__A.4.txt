ABSTRACT
Purpose. To conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of orthokeratology in slowing myopia progression.
Methods. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Methodological quality of the
literature was evaluated according to the Jadad score. The statistical analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.2.6 software.
Results. The present meta-analysis included seven studies (two randomized controlled trials and five nonrandomized
controlled trials) with 435 subjects (orthokeratology group, 218; control group, 217) aged 6 to 16 years. The follow-up time
was 2 years for the seven studies. The weighted mean difference was j0.26 mm (95% confidence interval, j0.31 to j0.21;
p G 0.001) for axial length elongation based on data from seven studies and j0.18 mm (95% confidence interval, j0.33 to
j0.03; p = 0.02) for vitreous chamber depth elongation based on data from two studies.
Conclusions. Our results suggest that orthokeratology may slow myopia progression in children. Further large-scale studies
are needed to substantiate the current result and to investigate the long-term effects of orthokeratology in myopia control.

yopia has become one of the most common ocular
disorders worldwide. The prevalence of myopia is
about 20 to 50% in Europe and the United States and
is up to 70% or even higher than 80% for young adults in some
parts of East Asia.1Y5 High myopia is a risk factor for cataract,
glaucoma, myopic retinopathy, and retinal detachment.6Y9 Therefore, it is very important to slow or even stop the progression of
myopia in children.
Many researchers are investigating ways to control myopia
progression. Several medical treatments have been considered to
suppress myopia progression, including topical application of
tropicamide,10 atropine,11 and pirenzepine.12 Nevertheless, there
have been no ideal therapeutic modalities to effectively prevent
myopic progression in light of efficacy, safety, economic feasibility, and ease of application.2,13 Orthokeratology, an optical
correction mainly for correcting low-to-moderate myopia, is
showing a potential to reduce the progression of myopia.14Y20 It is

reversible and if the patient is unhappy with the treatment, he or
she can simply discontinue wearing the lenses.
Axial length (AL) elongation is the most important factor in
myopia progression.21 A number of nonrandomized controlled
trials (non-RCTs) have reported that AL elongation in subjects
wearing orthokeratology lenses were 36 to 56% slower when
compared with that of subjects wearing spectacles.14,16,17,20 Two
recent randomized single-masked studies also reported the efficacy
of orthokeratology for slowing axial growth in high and low
myopic children.18,19 These studies suggest that orthokeratology
may suppress myopia progression in children, but in general, the
sample sizes of these studies were relatively small. Therefore, it
would be valuable to conduct a quantitative and systematic summary of the evidence using rigorous methods. In the present study,
a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the results from published
studies on the efficacy of orthokeratology in myopia control.

Search Strategy
To find the relevant literature, PubMed, Embase, and the
Cochrane Library were searched. Reference lists of included trials
were also searched. There were no language or data restrictions in
searching trials. The date of searching databases ended November
16, 2013. The search strategy was based on combinations of

medical subject headings and free text words and the search terms
used were ‘‘orthokeratology,’’ ‘‘ortho-k,’’ ‘‘corneal reshaping contact
lens,’’ and ‘‘myopia,’’ ‘‘nearsight,’’ and ‘‘shortsight’’ in various
combinations. Retrieved articles were imported into EndNote X6
(Thomson Reuters, New York, NY) where duplicate articles were
manually removed.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Published studies, regardless of sample size, were included if
they (1) were controlled clinical trials, including RCTs and nonRCTs; (2) included myopic patients aged 18 years and younger;
(3) compared orthokeratology with control subjects (single-vision
spectacles or soft contact lenses); and (4) reported AL elongation
or more information relevant to myopia progression, for example,
vitreous chamber depth (VCD) elongation. The major reasons for
exclusion of studies were (1) review papers, (2) having no control
groups, and (3) having no relevant data. We also excluded conference abstracts that had not been published. If duplicated data
were presented in several studies, only the largest study was included. Article titles were screened for eligibility by two reviewers
(SJK and TK) independently, and abstracts or full texts were
reviewed as necessary.

Data Extraction
Two review authors (SJK and TK) independently extracted the
data from articles that met this study’s inclusion criteria. Two
authors resolved inconsistencies by discussion and consensus. The
following data were extracted from articles that met this study’s

253

inclusion criteria: name of first author, the year of publication and
location of the study, various intervention groups, number of
subjects, patient age, sex, duration of follow-up, and the baseline
refractive error. The outcome measures were AL elongation and
VCD elongation.
Missing SDs were derived from other statistics, such as p values
or confidence intervals (CIs) if needed.22 When a p value was
reported as, for example, p e 0.001, p = 0.001 was assumed.23 The
missing SDs were able to be captured from figures using GetData
Graph Digitizer 2.24 (available at http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/
index.php).
The methodological quality of the articles was evaluated using
the Jadad scale.24 This validated approach assesses randomization
(0 to 2 points), blinding (0 to 2 points), and withdrawals (0 to 1
point) on a five-point scale. This study followed the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses) statement.25

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with RevMan 5.2.6 software
(Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). In the present metaanalysis, the effect sizes of each study were presented as weighted
mean difference (WMD) with 95% CIs for continuous outcome
measures (AL, VCD). The continuous outcome measures were
calculated by the inverse variance statistical method of randomeffects model. In the inverse variance method, the weight given to
each study is chosen to be the inverse of the variance of the effect
estimate and is expressed as the percentage of every weight in the
overall weight.23 The statistical heterogeneity was tested by using the

I2 statistic. The statistical heterogeneity was considered significant
when the I2 statistic was greater than or equal to 50%. Because
patient characteristics, region, the baseline refraction error, and
other confounding factors were not consistent between studies, we
further performed sensitivity analysis to examine the influence of
various exclusion criteria on the overall pooled estimate. We also
investigated the influence of a single study on the overall pooled
estimate by omitting each study in turn. The sensitivity analysis was
only performed for changes in AL because of the small number of
studies reporting changes in VCD. The pooled effect sizes were
considered significant when the 95% CI of WMD did not cross
zero. We did not analyze publication bias because of the limited
number of studies.

RESULTS
Search Results
A total of 461 studies were identified by the initial database
search, of which 439 studies were excluded because they were duplicates or irrelevant to our subject. The remaining 22 full-text
studies were carefully reviewed for more detailed evaluation, and
15 of them were excluded. Thus, two RCTs18,19 and five nonRCTs14Y17,20 published from 2005 to 2013 were included in the
final meta-analysis. Fig. 1 shows the process of filtering articles to
determine their appropriate value for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

Characteristics and Quality of Trials
A total of 435 subjects (orthokeratology group, 218; control
group, 217) aged 6 to 16 years were included in the present metaanalysis. The basic characteristics of the included studies are described in Table 1. Among these seven studies, five studies14,16,18Y20
were performed in East Asia, one study was performed in Europe,17
and one study was performed in America.15 All studies included
reported the AL, and two studies also reported VCD. The
follow-up time was 2 years for the seven studies. The quality
assessment of studies included in this meta-analysis is presented
in Table 1.

Meta-analysis
The gold standard for determining myopic progression is the
elongation of AL26; hence, we selected the AL changes as the first
outcome measure. As the SDs in the article by Walline et al.15 were
missing, we derived the SDs from the p values using the method
reported by Wiebe et al.22 We also captured missing SDs from the
study by Santodomingo-Rubido et al.17 from published figures
using GetData Graph Digitizer 2.24. The results showed that
AL increased with time in both orthokeratology and control
subjects. At 2 years follow-up, the AL elongation of the orthokeratology group was significantly slower than that of the control
group (WMD, j0.26 mm; 95% CI, j0.31 to j0.21; p G 0.001)
(Fig. 2). We performed sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of

the results. Table 2 shows the results of sensitivity analysis based
on various exclusion criteria for AL. All groups in Table 2 showed
insignificant heterogeneity: I2 e 50%, p Q 0.10. We also assessed
the influence of individual studies on the combined risk estimate
by sequentially excluding each study in turn to test the stability of
the main results. The exclusion of any single study did not materially alter the overall combined WMD, which ranged from
j0.25 mm (95% CI, j0.31 to j0.20; p G 0.001) to j0.27 mm
(95% CI, j0.33 to j0.22; p G 0.001).
Two studies reported VCD,14,15 which increased with time in
both groups of subjects. The VCD changes in the orthokeratology
group were significantly slower than those in the control group
(WMD, j0.18 mm; 95% CI, j0.33 to j0.03; p = 0.02) (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
The major purpose of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate
the efficacy of orthokeratology in myopia control. Our metaanalysis suggests that compared with control, orthokeratology
may effectively reduce the elongation of AL to a certain extent,
with mean differences of j0.26 mm in 2 years. Moreover, the
difference between orthokeratology and control in VCD elongation was j0.18 mm in 2 years. Exclusion of any single study
and sensitivity analysis based on various exclusion criteria did not
materially alter the pooled results, which added robustness to our
main result.
Some early reports27Y29 described apparent effectiveness of
overnight orthokeratology for arresting the progression of myopia.
Subsequently, retrospective and prospective studies provided
further evidence in support of the effectiveness of treatment. These
results indicated that orthokeratology could suppress myopia
progression with mean difference for AL elongation between
orthokeratology and control ranging from j0.22 to j0.33 mm
in 2 years.14Y20 In our study, the meta-analysis that combined
seven studies with 435 subjects (orthokeratology group, 218;
control group, 217) indicated a similar result and confirmed the
efficacy of orthokeratology for myopia control.
The mechanism by which orthokeratology might control myopic eye growth is still debatable. It has been proposed that relative
peripheral hyperopic defocus in myopes may trigger axial elongation.30,31 Recent animal studies indicate that form deprivation
that is limited to the peripheral retina can produce myopic eye
growth in monkeys, despite ablation of the fovea with an argon

laser.32 In human studies, myopic eyes experience more relative
hyperopia in the periphery, on average, than hyperopic and
emmetropic eyes.33 Furthermore, results from the CLEERE
(Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Ethnicity and Refractive Error) study indicated that children who become myopic have
more relative hyperopic peripheral refractive error than emmetropic children 2 years before the onset of myopia.34 Therefore,
peripheral hyperopia may act as a signal for increased eye growth.
The correction of peripheral hyperopia may be the mechanism of
orthokeratology in the suppressing of myopic eye growth. In
orthokeratology, the central cornea is flattened, reducing the axial
myopia, whereas the midperipheral cornea remains relatively
steeper, leading to relative peripheral myopia in myopic eyes. The
peripheral myopia created by orthokeratology reduces peripheral
hyperopic defocus, and this may reduce the visual feedback for eye
elongation, leading to slower myopic progression.35Y37 In contrast, the CLEERE group’s later study38 found that hyperopic
relative peripheral refractive error was not a significant risk factor
for the onset of myopia as a whole. However, the association
between more hyperopic relative peripheral refractive error and

the risk of the onset of myopia varied by ethnic group, with Asian
American children having the highest risk. Thus, whether relative
peripheral hyperopic defocus acts as an important mechanism
by which orthokeratology might control myopia progression is
still uncertain. Furthermore, researchers have found that many
other factors may influence the effectiveness of myopia control
with orthokeratology, including corneal relative peripheral power
change,39 levels of parental myopia,40 and pupil sizes.41 All factors
mentioned above serve to remind us that the mechanism by which
orthokeratology might control myopic eye growth may be complex.
This study has several limitations. First, our analysis was based
on only seven studies (two RCTs and five non-RCTs) with relatively small sample sizes, thus limiting the reliability of the results. Second, the targeted population varied greatly, and study
protocols and designs differed. These factors may have potential
effects on our results. Third, the study by Walline et al.15 was
included in this meta-analysis, although soft contact lenses were
used as control. Moreover, most trials included in the present
meta-analysis were performed in Asia, and only two studies15,17
were conducted outside this region in America and Spain.
Further studies should focus on the following two points. First,
although RCTs for orthokeratology are difficult to carry out,
using RCTs can leave little room for bias, and the results of RCTs
are more convincing. Therefore, future large-scale RCTs to investigate the effects of orthokeratology on myopia progression are
still important. Second, because the mechanism of myopia progression is still debatable, additional animal and human studies
will be needed to further elucidate the potential biological
mechanisms that are involved.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that orthokeratology
can reduce the progression of myopia to a certain extent. The
results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution
because of the limitations discussed above. Further large-scale
studies are needed to substantiate the current results and to investigate the long-term effects of orthokeratology in myopia control.
