SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports prevalence data combined independently for accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, visual field loss, and visual acuity loss in patients with traumatic brain injury in the absence
of eye injury.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the
prevalence rates of accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, visual field loss, and visual acuity loss
in TBI patients without concomitant eye injury.
DATA SOURCES: The data sources used in this study were PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Publications reporting the prevalence of diagnosed accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, visual field loss, or visual acuity loss to the level of legal blindness in
TBI patients of any age were included. Univariate metaregression analyses and subgroup analyses were performed
to account for statistical heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible publications were identified across the four visual conditions. Random-effects
models yielded combined prevalence estimates: accommodative dysfunction (42.8; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 31.3 to 54.7), convergence insufficiency (36.3%; 95% CI, 28.2 to 44.9%), visual field loss (18.2%; 95%
CI, 10.6 to 27.1%), and visual acuity loss (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0 to 1.1%). Metaregression and subgroup analyses
revealed that visual field loss was significantly more prevalent in moderate to severe (39.8%; 95% CI, 29.8 to
50.3%) compared with mild TBI (6.6%; 95% CI, 0 to 19.5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: This study demonstrates that accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, and visual field loss are common sequelae of TBI. Prospective longitudinal research with rigorous and uniform methodology is needed to better understand short- and long-term effects of
TBI on the vision system.

Traumatic brain injury is defined as an alteration in brain function or other evidence of brain pathology caused by an external
force.1 In 2013 alone, an estimated 2.8 million people in the
United States sustained a traumatic brain injury, most commonly
from falls, being struck by or against an object, and motor vehicle
accidents.2 In the military, more than 375,000 cases of traumatic
brain injury were reported in service members since 2000,3 many
of them as a result of powerful explosive blast events. Retrospective
studies show that 65 to 79% of traumatic brain injury patients report subjective visual complaints4–9; however, prevalence of the
underlying visual dysfunctions attributed to self-reported symptoms varies substantially between these studies for reasons including inconsistent diagnostic and reporting methods, varying sample
population demographics, and the many possible mechanisms of
injury. Given the limitations of available retrospective data and
the dearth of studies that prospectively recruit unbiased patient
samples, this study was undertaken to obtain more accurate prevalence estimates. Thus, the purpose of this study is to use available
published scientific data to estimate the prevalence of four visual
outcomes often considered to be associated with traumatic brain
injury: accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, visual field loss, and visual acuity loss.10–16 Furthermore, univariate

metaregression and subgroup analyses were performed to better
account for the observed heterogeneity.

METHODS
Systematic Literature Search
Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library) were queried for relevant literature published before August
2, 2017. Although settings and interfaces varied between these
databases, an identical search strategy was adapted for each database. The complete search strategy can be found in the Appendix
(available at http://links.lww.com/OPX/A408). Briefly, search
terms were organized into four concepts: (1) prevalence, (2) head
injury, (3) vision, and (4) deficit/dysfunction. Terms within each
category were separated by the Boolean operator “OR,” and each
category was parenthesized and separated by the operator
“AND.” When possible, Medical Subject Heading terms or the “explode” qualifier was used to expand the search language. All citations were imported and managed using EndNote X7.7.1 (Clarivate
Analytics, Philadelphia, PA). Two authors of the current study (DWB,
KM) worked independently to screen title and abstracts for relevant

articles; arbitration of disagreements was performed by an independent
third author (RKM). Two authors (DWB, RKM) then worked independently to review full-text articles of all articles marked relevant to confirm
eligibility; arbitration of disagreements was performed by two authors of
the current study (FMB, NM). Recent systematic reviews on the topic
were scanned for appropriate literature10,14,17; bibliographies of all included articles were scanned for relevant references.

To the extent possible, an individual patient was represented
only once for each visual outcome calculation. When necessary,
study authors were contacted to determine the existence or degree
of patient overlap between their publications. In instances of cohort overlap between two or more studies, the larger or more recent
publication was chosen for inclusion14; some notable studies were
excluded as a result of this process.5,6,19–21

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Data Extraction

The criteria for literature inclusion were as follows: (1) traumatic
brain injury or comparable head injury was diagnosed by a trained
medical professional; (2) screening and/or diagnostic testing for
accommodative dysfunction (insufficiency or infacility), convergence insufficiency, visual field loss, or visual acuity loss (visual
acuity equal to 20/200 or worse) was performed by an eye care provider; and (3) the article was published in English in a peer-reviewed
journal, and full text was available. There were no restrictions for
period or patient age, with the exception that accommodation
was only measured in nonpresbyopic traumatic brain injury populations 40 years or younger.
Studies were excluded based on the following criteria: (1)
single-case report design was used; (2) the sample population
was artificially selected for one of the visual outcomes (i.e., patients were recruited because of visual symptoms likely secondary
to the visual outcome); (3) the sample population was previously diagnosed as having a chronic (or other) eye condition (e.g., glaucoma
and diabetic retinopathy); (4) brain injury was acquired in a manner
unrelated to trauma (e.g., stroke and infection); and (5) either traumatic brain injury or visual outcomes were self-reported or otherwise
not clinically diagnosed. Efforts were made to remove the impact of
ocular/orbital injury on visual diagnoses: patients/publications were
excluded if there was evidence of eye injury (e.g., intraocular hemorrhage and open globe injury) that could explain visual symptoms. Applicable data were restricted to traumatic brain injury patients
diagnosed as having one or more of these four visual outcomes.
These data did not include baseline prevalence comparisons, calculation of risk statistics, or assessment of the effectiveness of interventions for these outcomes. Review articles rarely reported
original data and were therefore excluded from statistical analysis;
however, reviews were used as resources to find relevant literature.

Prevalence statistics of the four visual outcomes were extracted
directly from tables or the reported text. Initial data extraction was
performed by two authors who worked together (DWB, RKM); arbitration of disagreements was performed through discussion with
two additional authors (FMB, NM). A second review of data extraction was performed by one author (RKM) with any issues resolved
through discussion with two additional authors (FMB, NM). Confidence intervals were estimated according to the Clopper-Pearson
method22 at the 95% level. When available, additional contextual
data extracted from each study included the following: geographic
location (by country), age of participants, participant sex ratio, target population (i.e., defining characteristics of the recruited population), causes of traumatic brain injury (i.e., mechanism of injury),
time elapsed from the traumatic brain injury until the eye
examination/screening, severity of traumatic brain injury, study design, and visual deficit/dysfunction testing criteria.

Study Selection
Reported data regarding the prevalence of accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, visual field loss, and visual acuity loss were gathered by conducting the systematic literature search
described previously. All reported accommodative dysfunction data
reflect accommodative measures relative to age-related thresholds.
Visual field loss was defined as any type of diagnosed visual field defect consistent with post-chiasmal injury such as hemianopia,
quadrantanopia, or scotoma; visual field defects attributed to prechiasmal optic nerve or retinal damage were excluded. Visual acuity
loss was defined as a Snellen visual acuity estimate or comparable
measure at the level of “legal blindness” (20/200 or worse).18
Duplicate articles were removed, and the remaining publications were screened by title and abstract for possible inclusion. A
thorough full-text review of all remaining articles was subsequently
completed. Additional articles were added to the initial list after review of bibliographies contained in the included articles. All steps
were performed independently by two reviewers (DWB, KM); arbitration of disagreements was performed by an independent third
reviewer (RKM).

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using R statistical software (3.4.2)23 and its “meta” and “metafor” package.24 Prevalence rates were calculated by dividing the number of individuals
with traumatic brain injury diagnosed with the visual outcome by
the total number of individuals diagnosed as having traumatic
brain injury. These rates were transformed via Freeman-Tukey's25
double-arcsine method, as it best accounts for extreme values
(near 0 or 1) and is appropriate for meta-analyses of prevalence.26
Studies were weighted per their effect size using the reciprocal of
variance (i.e., inverse variance) of the transformed proportions. A
continuity correction of 0.5 was applied to all prevalence estimates
of zero.27 Forest plots of each visual outcome were presented as
back-transformed data (i.e., raw prevalence) using the “metaprop”
and “forest” commands. Variances were combined using the
DerSimonian-Laird28 random-effects model. Between-study variance (τ2) was estimated using the restricted maximal likelihood
method,29 as it best accommodates metaregression analyses, and
heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 (I2
values <40, 30 to 60, 50 to 90, and ≥75% were deemed low, moderate, substantial, and considerable heterogeneity, respectively).30
Cochran Q has demonstrated low power under certain circumstances
and was therefore deemed statistically significant at P values less
than .10.31 An iterative influence analysis using the leave-one-out
method was performed for each outcome to determine whether any
single study was disproportionately influential in any of the respective combined prevalence estimates.32,33 Subgroup analysis was
performed for four moderators: (1) study design (prospective vs. retrospective), (2) traumatic brain injury severity, (3) diagnostic
criteria, and (4) risk of bias to compare the prevalence rates among
different levels of moderators by considering the meta-analysis result
from each group separately. Methodological risk of bias of each
study was appraised via criteria validated by Hoy et al.34 Upon assessment of methodological risk of bias,34 studies ranged from 0
to 6 (Table 1). The overall risk-of-bias score for each study was

grouped into low risk of bias (score of 0 to 3), medium risk of bias
(score of 4 to 6), and high risk of bias (score 7 to 9); a higher score
indicates greater risk of bias.34 All of the studies in this article
ranged from low to medium risk of bias.
Univariate metaregression analyses of prevalence by several
moderators were conducted to investigate the sources of heterogeneity in each of the four visual outcomes. The moderators
were considered as categorical variables with mostly binary outcomes. The risk-of-bias moderator was a binary outcome with
low and moderate categories of risk of bias, and severity of traumatic brain injury was a binary outcome with mild (Glasgow
Coma Scale score 13 to 15) and moderate-to-severe (Glasgow
Coma Scale score 3 to 12) categories.
When Glasgow Coma Scale, or comparable metric, was not reported, explicit attribution of mild or moderate/severe traumatic
brain injury in the publication text was considered; for this analysis,
sports concussions were not considered mild traumatic brain injury. Study authors were contacted when traumatic brain injury severity distinctions were unclear. Many individual publications
reported visual outcome prevalence statistics stratified by traumatic
brain injury severity, which provided an opportunity to use subpopulations from a single article in more than one category.4,35,42 Statistics reported for metaregression analyses were the test statistic for

the omnibus test of coefficients (i.e., the test for the effect of a
moderator; Cochran Q), percentage of heterogeneity accounted
for R2, and Higgins I2 for individual subgroups.
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied to
metaregression analyses such that Cochran Q was deemed statistically significant at less than 0.025.

RESULTS
Search Results
Database searches yielded 2104 unique publications. Of these,
2082 publications were excluded primarily because of a sample
population comprising non–traumatic brain injury patients, lack
of measurements for pertinent visual outcomes or being preselected
for visual symptoms consistent with the visual outcome, not examined by an eye care provider, missing data, or being a foreignlanguage article. After title and abstract screening and full-text
review, 22 publications met the criteria for inclusion.4,7–9,35–51
The selection process summarized in Fig. 1 is in accordance with
standardized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-analyses guidelines.54 On several occasions, data on
more than one visual outcome were extracted from the same

publication. Taking these into account, 11 publications reported
accommodative dysfunction data,4,7–9,35–38,43–45 14 reported
convergence insufficiency data,4,7–9,35,37–41,43,44,50,52 14 reported visual field loss data,4,7–9,35–37,42,46–49,51,52 and 6 reported visual acuity loss data.4,7,8,35,41,43

Study Characteristics
Characteristics of the included studies can be found in Table 2.
The studies were predominantly conducted in the United States
(86.3%), but patients from Africa, Asia, and Europe were also represented. Patients ranged in age from 7 months to 91 years and
were generally recruited from one of three subpopulations: (1) military service members and/or veterans, (2) athletes, or (3) the
catchment area surrounding local hospitals; female patients were
underrepresented, particularly among military groups. The most
commonly reported mechanisms of traumatic brain injury were motor vehicle accidents, blast-related injuries, sports-related injuries,
and falls.

Accommodative Dysfunction
The combined sample represents 1271 traumatic brain injury
patients who were screened for accommodative dysfunction. The
methods of assessing accommodation varied among the studies
(Table 2); tests for accommodative insufficiency, infacility, or both
were most common. Prevalence of accommodative dysfunction
ranged from 13 to 80.0% across the included studies with a combined prevalence of 42.8% (95% confidence interval, 31.3 to
54.7%; Fig. 2). This estimate was considerably heterogeneous (Q
[10] = 115.64; P < .0001; I2 = 91.35%), although no single study
was disproportionately influential. None of the four metaregression
analyses (study design, traumatic brain injury severity, diagnostic
criteria, and risk of bias) accounted for a significant portion of heterogeneity. The combined prevalence estimate of studies explicitly
reporting on mild traumatic brain injury patients, the most common
form of traumatic brain injury, was 43.2% (95% confidence interval, 29.2 to 57.7%).

Convergence Insufficiency
Across all studies, 2140 traumatic brain injury patients were
screened for convergence insufficiency. Other convergence dysfunctions were sought, but only one study evaluated for convergence excess,7 and none evaluated for convergence infacility.
Testing methods for convergence involved the current state of the
commonly used clinical criteria accepted by the field; hence, either
the singular use of near point of convergence or any combination of
near point of convergence, fusional vergence, and eye alignment
testing was used (Table 2); diagnostic cutoffs for the near point
of convergence test varied from 6 to 12.7 cm (5 inches). The estimated prevalence in each study ranged from 14.7 to 71.4%. The
combined prevalence was 36.3% (95% confidence interval,
28.2 to 44.9%; Fig. 3); these data were considerably heterogeneous (Q[13] = 129.20; P < .0001; I2 = 89.94%), but influence
analysis did not specify any single study as disproportionately influential. None of the four metaregression analyses (study design,
traumatic brain injury severity, diagnostic criteria, and risk of bias)
accounted for a statistically significant portion of the reported heterogeneity (R2 < 0.21; P > .03). The combined prevalence estimate of the studies explicitly reporting on mild traumatic brain
injury patients, the most common form, was 37.2% (95% confidence interval, 24.3 to 51.1%).
www.optvissci.com

Visual Field Loss
In the combined sample, 2106 patients underwent visual field
testing. The specific types of visual field loss experienced by these
patients, when reported, included homonymous or nonhomonymous
hemianop(s)ia,4,35,42,47,49,51 quadrantanop(s)ia,4,35,42,47 visual
field constriction/tunnel vision,4,47,51 and central or paracentral scotoma.4,47,51 Two publications in the included literature presented
diagnoses of cortical blindness resulting from damage to the occipital region of the brain causing visual acuity and visual field loss.47,49
The authors did not comment on the extent of visual impairment
(i.e., partial or complete) or the visual acuity estimate associated
with cortical blindness; therefore, cortical blindness was treated as
a post-chiasmal visual field defect rather than a loss of visual acuity.
Visual fields were most often assessed via confrontation and/or a
handheld perimeter; however, Goldmann and automated perimetry
were also used. Individual publications presented prevalence estimates between 0.0 and 50.5%. The combined prevalence estimate
was 18.2% (95% confidence interval, 10.6 to 27.1%; Fig. 4);
statistical heterogeneity was considerable (Q[13] = 177.22;
P < .0001; I2 = 92.67%), but influence analysis did not reveal
any single study as disproportionately driving the combined estimate. Metaregression analyses revealed that traumatic brain injury severity accounted for a significant portion of the observed
heterogeneity. Patients with mild traumatic brain injury demonstrated visual field loss at a rate of 6.6% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 19.5%), whereas patients with moderate to severe
traumatic brain injury had visual field loss at 39.8% (95% confidence interval, 29.8 to 50.3%; R2 = 64.80; P = .0006). Risk of
bias, study design, and diagnostic criteria were not statistically
significant moderators (R2 = 0.22; P > .06).

Visual Acuity Loss
Visual acuity was measured in 1333 traumatic brain injury patients. All studies used a Snellen chart/card or comparable metric
to assess visual acuity (Table 2); therefore, an analysis comparing
diagnostic testing criteria was not performed. Prevalence of visual
acuity loss at increasingly worse levels was reported, but inconsistent reporting methods across the studies made combined
prevalence estimates untenable. However, data regarding the
prevalence of visual acuity worse than or equal to 20/200 (i.e., legal blindness)18 were available and ranged from 0.0 to 3.4%. This
degree of visual acuity loss is rare; the combined prevalence estimate was 0.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1%; Fig. 5);
this estimate exhibited lower heterogeneity (Q[5] = 13.21;
P < .02; I2 = 62.2%) compared with previous cases, and no single
study was disproportionately influential. The current study was unable to confirm a single case of visual acuity loss in mild traumatic
brain injury patients (0.0%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to
0.0%), whereas moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury patients
experienced this deficit at a rate of 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 9.3%). The result needs to be interpreted with caution
because only one study with moderate-to-severe data was available
for the analysis.

DISCUSSION
Accommodative dysfunction and convergence insufficiency
are the most prevalent of the four visual outcomes examined in
this study, occurring in 42.8 and 36.3% of traumatic brain injury patients, respectively. The accommodation and convergence

Risk of bias is based on 10 criteria formulated and validated by Hoy et al.,34 where a higher score indicates greater bias; two scores are presented in some
cases because of insufficient reporting of diagnostic criteria for some but not all visual outcomes. Information presented in the “visual deficit/dysfunction
testing criteria” column is discretized by the visual condition. *Evaluation was done by an American at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany. AC/
A = accommodative convergence per unit of accommodation; AD = accommodative dysfunction; CI = convergence insufficiency; MVA = motor vehicle

pathways rely on a decentralized and extensive neural architecture
involving mesencephalic brainstem nuclei, premotor and motor
cortex, cerebellum, and oculomotor, abducens, and trochlear
nerves. Focal damage to a critical component of this system, diffuse or shearing forces along the visual pathway, or intracranial
edema, hematoma, or hemorrhage therefore can commonly lead
to deficient ability of the eyes to accommodate and/or converge,55
which is usually independent of any decrement in visual acuity.
The variety of damaging events that can lead to accommodative
dysfunction and/or convergence insufficiency provides plausible
reasoning for the high prevalence rates reported in this study.
Visual field loss occurs in approximately 18.2% of traumatic
brain injury patients according to this study. The assessment of visual field loss in a traumatic brain injury patient is complicated by
the varied nature of head injuries and the probability of an associated ocular injury. Individuals can demonstrate visual field loss
by sustaining a direct ocular injury and/or an injury to the intracranial visual pathways resulting in damage to segments of the visual
pathway ranging from the retina to the occipital cortex.56,57 To ensure that the results of the current study were based solely on the
impact of a brain injury and not ocular injury, only visual field loss
secondary to post-chiasmal injury was considered. Such defects
are often perceived bilaterally by the patient (e.g., hemianopia
and quadrantanopia)57 and are considered to occur secondary to
an injury to the intracranial portion of the visual pathway. The current study indicates that visual acuity loss at the level of legal blindness is rarely associated with only traumatic brain injury. A
probable explanation is that visual sequelae resulting from ocular,
retinal, or optic nerve damage were excluded from this analysis.
In most cases, traumatic visual acuity loss is related to prechiasmal damage and occurs in the setting of severe head trauma
associated with loss of consciousness.58 The relatively low prevalence of visual acuity loss due to neurologic consequences of traumatic brain injury suggests that the test for visual acuity, which is
the most commonly performed measure of the visual system, is
an insufficient stand-alone surrogate for overall visual health. In
fact, most traumatic brain injury patients in the current study had
little if any loss of acuity; three studies reported that all patients
with mild forms of traumatic brain injury had better than or equal
to 20/25 vision.7,37,43 Therefore, patients with a history of head injury should be evaluated by an eye care provider (i.e., optometrist or
ophthalmologist) who can render a comprehensive eye examination
www.optvissci.com

to look for these subtle changes in visual function, including direct
injuries to the eye, which were not included in this study but are
known to be commonly associated with head injuries and traumatic
brain injury.59 Such a comprehensive examination would include
the following: medical history, visual acuity, measurement of refractive error, external examination, pupillary testing, distance
and near cover testing, visual field testing, extraocular muscle
movement assessment including version and vergence functions,
accommodative assessment, tonometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopy,
binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy, and gonioscopy. The current
study did not use comparative baseline rates of the studied visual
outcomes in otherwise healthy individuals that would allow for risk
metrics to be calculated. Although baseline rates or control groups
were infrequently reported in the literature collected here, prevalence statistics for visual outcomes in populations with no history
of head injury have been reported previously. Rates of accommodative dysfunction in otherwise healthy individuals were reported to
be between 5.8 and 32.4%,37,60–64 which is lower than 42.8% reported in the current study. Convergence insufficiency was previously reported in 4.2 to 31.4% of otherwise healthy
populations11,37,61,63–67 compared with 36.3% reported in traumatic brain injury patients here. Baseline visual field loss data
are rare and generally measured in older adults; however, CapóAponte et al.37 reported 0% visual field loss in otherwise healthy
military personnel aged 20 to 43 years, and Ramrattan et al.68 reported a prevalence of 3% in civilians aged 55 to 64 years. These
estimates are notably lower than 18.2% in the current study.
Lastly, baseline rates of visual acuity loss to the level of legal blindness were reported at less than 1%,60,69,70 which is comparable
with the approximately 0% reported in traumatic brain injury
patients here.

Prevalence Stratified by Traumatic Brain
Injury Severity
The prevalence estimates harvested from each study included
in the current analysis varied substantially. It was hypothesized
that this heterogeneity could be partially explained by the severity
of traumatic brain injury. To address this question, the prevalence
of the four studied visual outcomes was stratified into either mild
traumatic brain injury or moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury
categories, and metaregression analyses and subgroup analyses

were performed (Fig. 6). The prevalence of accommodative dysfunction and convergence insufficiency did not differ in patients
with mild versus moderate to severe traumatic brain injury according to the current analysis. However, the data for accommodative
dysfunction need to be interpreted with caution because only one
study with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury data was

available for the analysis. This study comparison combined data
across studies frequently using different diagnostic approaches
(Table 2) and often did not stratify prevalence by the types of accommodative issues (e.g., accommodative insufficiency and
infacility). However, the study findings comport with Brahm et al.4
and Alvarez et al.,35 who did report these traumatic brain injury

severity comparisons using their respective, internally consistent,
diagnostic methodologies and found no differences in visual dysfunctions between traumatic brain injury severity levels. It should
also be noted that the specific neurological abnormalities responsible for accommodative and convergence issues are rarely investigated in individual cases. More detailed research is likely to shed
greater light on this issue.
In contrast, post-chiasmal visual field loss demonstrated significance for higher prevalence associated with moderate to severe
traumatic brain injury (39.8%) compared with mild traumatic brain
injury (6.6). This observation is consistent with previous research
showing that more severe forms of traumatic brain injury, particularly with distributed cerebral pathology involving the occipital
lobe, optic radiations, or optic tract, lead to higher rates of postchiasmal visual field loss.57,71
When the prevalence of visual acuity loss (legal blindness equal
to or worse than 20/200) was stratified by the severity of traumatic
brain injury, no cases were reported in mild traumatic brain injury

patients compared with 3.2% in moderate to severe traumatic
brain injury, but these data need to be interpreted with caution because only one reference with moderate to severe traumatic brain
injury was found. Although disparate visual acuity categorization
presented in the existing literature precluded a comparison of visual acuity at less severe levels in the current study, one study
did report infrequent moderate visual acuity loss (worse than 20/
100) in Polytrauma Network Site outpatients (1.6%) compared
with Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center inpatients (12.7%).4

Other Moderating Variables and Their Relationship
with Visual Outcome Prevalence
In addition to traumatic brain injury severity, the studies were
evaluated on the association of the prevalence rates with risk of bias,
diagnostic criteria, and study design (prospective vs. retrospective).
Methodological risk of bias was used not only to assess the literature
at large but also to determine if biased studies impacted reported

prevalence rates in a meaningful way. Criteria validated by Hoy
et al.34 were used to appraise the studies on the recruited sample
population, the types of recruitment used, study instruments and
measurement validation, and statistical approach. The general population was represented at higher rates (63%) than service members
and/or veterans (37%), which decreased the bias of recruited samples. The studies used for the analysis had either low or medium risk
of bias, with overall risk of bias in the low category (mean, 3.18/10).
Most studies used validated screening/diagnostic criteria for
both traumatic brain injury and visual outcome assessment (although some were not transparent about the tools used), and all
used appropriate statistical procedures. The screening/diagnostic
criteria for the visual dysfunctions varied significantly between different studies. Despite this variability, we did not observe an association between the screening/diagnostic methodology and the
prevalence rates for all four visual outcomes. No association was
observed between the type of study (prospective vs. retrospective)
and the prevalence rates.

Traumatic Brain Injury Resulting from Blast versus
Nonblast Events
Prevalence rates for the four studied visual outcomes may depend on the mechanism by which the brain injury was acquired.
Of particular interest is whether head injuries resulting from an explosive blast event (i.e., due to the blast overpressure wave and/or
head injury secondary to events of the blast) were related to differential visual dysfunction rates when compared with head injuries
resulting from nonblast events (e.g., sports-related trauma, falls,
and motor vehicle accidents). Several of the included publications
provided descriptions of the type(s) of injuring event that resulted
in traumatic brain injury (Table 2). Although the data for these parameters are very limited, our study did not show that the prevalence
www.optvissci.com

for the four visual outcomes is different in blast versus nonblast traumatic brain injury events.
Trauma secondary to direct, blunt, or penetrating injury to the
brain, as well as damage resulting from brain displacement (e.g.,
coup-contrecoup injury), can occur both in explosive blast or
nonblast scenarios.
Animal studies, computational analyses, and human brain pathology research have been used to examine whether the physical impact
of the blast overpressure wave, the only component unique to blast,
produces specific brain injuries separate from other traumatic brain
injury mechanisms of injury.53,72–77 In recent work, Tagge et al.73
compared the effects of the blast overpressure wave with direct head
impacts using computational simulation. This research showed that
direct impact generated high-pressure force loading onto a focused
contact area, whereas blast wave impact caused distributed, lowermagnitude force loading. Direct impact produced sevenfold greater
peak shear stress to the brain as compared with the blast wave.
Therefore, any effects due purely to blast overpressure on the visual
system are likely to be subtle and may be obscured by the more powerful effects of direct impact during the same blast event.
Indeed, Capó-Aponte et al.78 studied the isolated effects of
blast overpressure in Marine Corps “breachers” who encounter repetitive subconcussive blast exposure as part of their training. Although the results were suggestive of detrimental effects of the
low-level repetitive blast on corneal endothelial cell count, near
vertical phoria, and visual field sensitivity, all test results in the experimental group were within or only slightly lower than normative
value ranges. No differences were found in convergence, accommodation, or visual acuity measures.
Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that, although the current study and others did not detect a difference between blast and
nonblast events in visual symptoms measures, recent publications
suggest that blast events may evoke specific cellular and molecular

Optom Vis Sci 2019; Vol 96(8)

552

Visual Dysfunctions in TBI — Merezhinskaya et al.

effects in brain tissue. Shively et al.72 described a distinct pattern
of interface astroglial scarring in tissues adjacent to cerebrospinal
fluid at junctions between gray and white matter and around blood
vessels in brain specimens from military service members who
experienced blast exposure. Comparable glial deposition patterns were not observed in brain specimens from individuals
with a history of impact (i.e., nonblast) and traumatic brain injury or control cases with no history of traumatic brain injury. Future
research is needed to establish whether these neuropathological
findings are associated with specific short- and/or long-term
clinical manifestations.
It should also be noted that little is known about the visual complications that arise from the other possible mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (e.g., falls and assaults), as stratification by the
mechanism of injury in the literature is rare (however, see Alvarez
et al.,35 who did stratify visual outcomes by specific etiology including motor vehicle accidents, falls, and sports injuries).

Persistence of Visual Dysfunctions Secondary to
Traumatic Brain Injury
There is also conjecture in the field of vision science regarding
the persistence of visual dysfunctions after an individual sustains
a traumatic brain injury. Studies assessing a traumatic brain injury
patient's visual status at numerous time points during recovery are
infrequent and use subjective visual symptom data rather than administering comprehensive eye examinations.79,80 Despite the
lack of optimal evidence, a small number of publications, which
are included in the analyses previously, address the extent to which
visual outcomes are diagnosed in the long-term (i.e., chronic)
phase. Capó-Aponte et al.7 compared three cohorts whose constituents received diagnostic eye examinations at different periods
(i.e., ≤45 days, between 46 and 365 days, or >365 days) after
their traumatic brain injury. Although the small number of studies
did not allow for the generalization of the conclusion, this study
found no difference in the prevalence of accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, and visual field loss between the
three groups. In addition, Kowal81 documented the prevalence of
accommodative dysfunction (16%) and convergence insufficiency
(14%) in 161 patients shortly after head injury. Most patients with
accommodation and convergence issues were followed up for more
than 1 year, and at least 58 and 35% of these patients, respectively, experienced persisting symptoms. Despite the paucity of evidence explicitly addressing the prevalence of visual outcomes in
the chronic versus acute phase of traumatic brain injury recovery,
it is evident that traumatic visual dysfunctions can and do persist
in a substantial proportion of traumatic brain injury patients past
1 year after the injuring event.

Limitations
The nature of meta-analyses requires the combination of data
collected from various locations, sources, and authors. There are,
therefore, inherent limitations that should be acknowledged. A
primary limitation of the current study is the extent of statistical
heterogeneity in the data for accommodative dysfunction, convergence insufficiency, and visual field loss. Each of these combined prevalence estimates (Figs. 2 to 5) was associated with a
significantly high I2 statistic (each >90%). To further account
for some of the reported heterogeneity, univariate metaregression
analyses were performed.
www.optvissci.com

Limitations were apparent in the traumatic brain injury severity
analysis; it was common that either publications did not report the
severity of traumatic brain injury, or the patient sample was populated with individuals who sustained varying degrees of traumatic
brain injury. The traumatic brain injury severity analysis was further
complicated by the diagnosis of “concussion” in several publications,44,50 which lacks the same accepted severity distinctions
used in traumatic brain injury and is often but not always82,83
deemed synonymous with mild traumatic brain injury. For these
reasons, many publications were excluded from metaregression
analyses, which reduced the power and generalizability of subsequent conclusions. Similar challenges restricted the utility of the
screening/diagnostic testing criteria moderator.
Categorization of disparate approaches into logical categories
was exceedingly difficult; for example, testing criteria in a distinct
category necessarily overlapped with those of neighboring categories.
This problem is magnified by some studies not providing sufficient
methodological detail for their testing criteria. Additional attempts
were made to account for differences between studies based on age
of participants, sex ratio, target population, geographic location, and
year of study, but these factors largely failed to explain variability
among visual outcome prevalence estimates (data not shown). The
metaregression analyses suggest that no single factor was responsible
for the observed statistical heterogeneity.

Recommendations
Traumatic brain injury is a time-related process involving injury,
short-term change, and longer-term recovery, which can persist
chronically, all processes that are not well understood. A carefully
constructed prospective trial with a large sample and consistent
evaluation techniques would have a tremendous impact on the
field and would address the various limitations outlined previously.
An ideal trial would recruit unbiased samples of consecutive patients from hospitals, emergency departments, military treatment facilities, and/or Veterans Affairs; record demographic
characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and occupation) and injury specifics (e.g., etiology, severity, comorbid conditions such as eye
injuries, and imaging results); would require complete examinations from eye care providers within a restricted time after injury
and additional follow-up, regardless of overt visual symptoms;
would mandate application of consistent diagnostic testing
criteria for each visual outcome; and would maintain detailed records of dosage, use, and compliance information for prescribed
drugs, devices, or interventions. Furthermore, to better understand chronicity, recovery, and management outcomes, this
study should be extended to incorporate a natural history design
over a longitudinal timeline.
The current study clearly shows that traumatic brain injury
damages the visual system in many ways and that, because visual
acuity is often unaffected, these visual outcomes are frequently
undetected. Therefore, all service members, veterans, and/or civilians who have experienced a traumatic brain injury should seek
(or be referred to) an eye care provider for a comprehensive eye examination as specified by the Veterans Health Administration Notice 2017-3584 and the Vision Center of Excellence Clinical
Recommendations for the Eye Care Provider. Further detail regarding the detection and management of traumatic brain injury–
associated visual dysfunctions is available in the Department of
Defense– and Veterans Affairs–approved Vision Center of Excellence clinical recommendations.85–87
