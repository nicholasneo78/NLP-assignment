Abstract: Tight oil refers to a petroleum play that occurs in a free or adsorbed state in source rocks
or tight reservoir rocks (e.g., sandstone and carbonate rock) interbedded with or close to source
rocks. Tight oil has generally not experienced large-scale, long-distance migration. According to
such a definition and its characteristics, 10 key indices are proposed for tight oil resource evaluation
in China. Tight oil reservoirs are divided into three groups in terms of porosity and permeability.
Tight oil can be classified into three types according to the contact relationship between the tight oil
reservoirs and source rocks, i.e., tight lacustrine carbonate oil, tight deep-lake gravity flow sandstones
oil, and tight deep-lake deltaic sandstones oil. In China, tight oil resources are widely distributed and
significant exploration discoveries have been achieved in the sixth member and seventh member of
the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin, the Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Junggar
Basin, the Middle-Lower Jurassic strata of the Sichuan Basin, and the Cretaceous Qingshankou
and Quantou Formations in the Songliao Basin. The total geological resources of tight oil in China
assessed by using the “analog” method are estimated to be (10.67–11.15) ×109 tones. Taking into
account of the future prospects of petroleum development, tight oil may become a realistic alternative
to the conventional oil resources in China.

1 Introduction
Tig ht oi l is a new fo ca l r esou rc e t y p e of t he g loba l
unconventional oil and gas resources following shale gas (Sun
et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011). The United States has attached
great importance to the exploration of tight oil (Daniel et al.,
2009) and attempts to replicate the shale gas development model
to achieve crude oil self-sufficiency. In 2006, a breakthrough
of tight oil production (over 7950 m3/d) was made in the Elm
Coulee Oilfield from the Bakken Formation in the Williston
Basin, which significantly increased the confidence of tight
oil exploration and attracted substantial investment. In 2008,
large-scale tight oil development was achieved in the Bakken
Formation. This progress was considered to be one of the global

top 10 discoveries for the year(Zou et al., 2011). In 2009, the
U.S. tight oil exploration and development investment reached at
$ 51.4 billion(Lu, 2011). In the following year, the U.S. tight oil
production exceeded 30×106 t, which for the first time reversed
its decreasing trend in oil production that had lasted for 24
years. In 2012 there were over 2000 tight oil wells in the U.S.
with an average single well oil production of 12 t/d(Zou et al.,
2011). Total tight oil production forecast of the U.S. is 150×106 t in 2010
(Zou et al., 2011), which will increase the nation’s total crude
oil production by 1/3 and thus greatly reduce its dependence
on foreign oil resources and to some extent change the global
energy structure.

In China, tight oil exploration was started relatively late and
the concept of tight oil has now been widely accepted in
recent years. Tight oil resources are widespread in China and
particularly rich in the sixth member and seventh member of the
Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin, the Permian
Lucaogou Formation in the Junggar Basin, the Middle to
Lower Jurassic strata in the Sichuan Basin, and the Cretaceous
Qingshankou and Quantou Formations in the Songliao Basin.
To date, great exploration discoveries have been achieved in
the above tight-oil-rich formations that have the potential for
large-scale accumulation and effective development. Through
research and deployment of tight oil, the industrial capacity
can be improved with the progress of exploitation technologies,
enabling tight oil to be an important alternative for future
replacement of oil resources in China.
Presently, tight oil exploration and development in China as
well as related research remain at an early preparation stage.
Overall, the levels of exploration and geological understanding
of tight oil are low, and a number of questions exist in the
basic geological theory, evaluation criteria, controlling factors,
resource potential, and exploration direction of tight oil plays.
Based on the most recent progress of tight oil exploration in
different tight-oil-rich formations in China, this study proposes
evaluation criteria for tight oil classification in China. The
key geological characteristics of tight oil are elucidated and
the resource prospects of tight oil are preliminarily evaluated
and forecasted. The work will provide supporting data for
exploration and continuous in-depth geological research of tight
oil in China.

2 Concept and evaluation criteria for
tight oil
2.1 Concept of tight oil
Tight oil is a petroleum that occurs in a free or adsorbed state
in source rocks or tight reservoir rocks (e.g., sandstone and
carbonate rock) interbedded with or close to source rocks, and
has not experienced large-scale long-distance migration (Fig.
1). In general, tight oil has the following characteristics: (1) a
large area of tight reservoirs with porosity < 10%, in-situ matrix
permeability > 0.l mD, and pore throat diameter <1μm (Zou
et al., 2012); (2) widespread, overlapped, mature high-quality
source beds (kerogen type I or II, average total organic carbon
>1.0%, and Ro from 0.6% to 1.0%); (3) the coexisting relationship
of continuously distributed tight reservoirs and source rocks
that are in close contact, with no obvious trap boundary or oil
reservoir(Zou et al., 2012); (4) the density of crude oil in tight
reservoirs >40°API or <0.83 g/cm3, i.e., relatively light oil.

2.2 Tight oil evaluation criteria
Large-scale exploration and efficient development of tight oil
mainly depend on following evaluation criteria: (1) Porosity
and permeability are two physical parameters that respectively
describe reserve and percolation capabilities of reservoir, in
accordance with the existing reservoir classification standards
and relevant exploration and development experiences, the
porosity of tight oil reservoirs under normal circumstances is
<10% and the in-situ matrix permeability is <0.1 mD. (2) Tight

2.3 Tight oil reservoir classification
Air permeability of 1 mD (in-situ matrix permeability is
generally 0.1 mD) is taken as the upper limit of tight oil
reservoir permeability for porosity statistics of major tight oil
reservoirs in China. Results show that China’s tight oil reservoirs
can be grouped into three categories according to porosity, i.e.,
Type I (porosity from 7 to 10%), Type II (porosity from 4 to 7%)
and Type III (porosity <4%) (Fig. 2).
Bases for classification: (1) the porosity of 7% is the lower limit for
percolation of water-free light oil in low-permeability rocks. When
the porosity of tight reservoirs is >7%, light oil is relatively freeflowing in a Darcy flow state; when the porosity of tight reservoirs is
<7%, light oil flow is dominated by non-Darcy flow and substantial
limited by starting pressure
gradient(Guo et al., 2009). (2) Tight

reservoirs with porosity
<4% are dominated y nanopores(Loucks

et al., 2009) and retains certain oil resources(Webster et al., 1984;
Schmoker and Hester, 1983; Miller et al., 2008; Daniel et al., 2009;
Loucks et a., 2009; Zeng and Jiang, 2009). However, quality of oil

resources is poor due to high costs of development and significant
difficulty in economic exploitation.

oil reservoir space consists primarily of organic pores, inorganic
pores and fractures, organic pores are dominated by kerogen
nanopores, while inorganic pores are dominated by dissolution
pores and residual primary pores. (3) Tight oil reservoirs are
generally distributed in sags or on slope zones and feature simple
tectonic structures, which are conducive to large-scale tight
oil accumulation. (4) Distribution area and reservoir thickness
for a given porosity are two geological parameters that jointly
determine reserve scale and economic development of tight
oil. According to published data, the distribution area of tight
oil is >10×103 km 2 in North America, and reservoir thickness
vary from 5 to 60 m, in contrast, the favorable area of tight
oil in the major basins in China is <2 ×103 km 2, and reservoir
thickness vary from 10 to 80 m. (5) Organic carbon content and
maturity, which determine generation conditions of tight oil,
generally TOC should be >1% and Ro range from 0.6 to1.3%,
respectively. Tight oil source rocks in North America contain
abundant organic matter with high TOC (4–10%). (6) Tight
oil reservoirs in North America generally have overpressure,
whereas those in the basins in China mostly have abnormal
overpressure (formation pressure coefficient >1.2) except for that
in Ordos Basin with abnormal low (negative) pressure. (7) Tight
oil is relatively light and mainly consists of light oil, the crude
oil density of tight oil is >40°API or <0.83 g/cm 3, suggesting
good mobility. (8) The burial depth of tight oil reservoirs is
generally 1000–3500 m (median), which is suitable for reservoir
development. (9) Tight oil reservoirs generally contain >35%
brittle minerals with well-developed natural fractures, these
conditions are favorable for the use of horizontal well fracturing
technology in improving single-well oil production. (10) Ground
conditions determines the extent of difficulty in engineering
construction and significantly affects the development cost.

3 Major types and characteristics of tight
oil in China
3.1 Overall characteristics and classification of
tight oil in China
Generally, characteristics of tight oil are as following: (1) source
rocks are presently in the oil window; (2) source and reservoir
rocks are interbedded or in close contact; (3) reservoirs are of tight
formations; (4) oil had not experienced large-scale long-distance
migration. Through analyses of oil-gas generation and evolution
characteristics of China’s major oil-gas-bearing basins, tight oil is
mainly distributed in Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental lacustrine
depositional system. Overall, China’s tight oil has the following
features: (1) there are three types of the continental basins in China,
i.e., fault depression basin, depression basin and foreland basin,
which developed multiple oil-generating sags and thus provide
favorable conditions for formation of tight oil (Fig. 3); (2) multiple
sets of high-quality source rocks are developed and evolved into oil
generation stage, source rocks that are most favorable for tight oil
formation generally have TOC >1% and Ro of 0.9–1.3%, gas-to-oil
ratios are relatively high, which contribute to the high oil mobility;
(3) tight oil reservoirs can be divided into two types, i.e., carbonate
rock and sandstone, lithologically, the reservoirs are quite diverse,
showing significant lateral variations in sandstones with some thin
interbeds and relatively large thickness of carbonate rocks; (4)
distribution area and size of tight oil reservoirs are relatively small,
generally are less than 2000 km2; (5) late-stage tectonic activities
are complex, and impact on preservation of tight oil.

environments, tight oil reservoirs that are in close contact with
major source rocks mainly have three genetic environments: (1)
salinized lacustrine carbonate depositional environment associated
with lake salinization, in which high-quality source rocks are
interbedded with carbonate-rich or salt layers, and salinized
lacustrine carbonate rocks are developed in dark shale of semideep to deep lacustrine facies, these conditions are excellent for
tight oil accumulation; (2) deep-lacustrine prodelta depositional
environment, which not only meets requirements of high-quality
argillaceous source rock deposits but also receives delta-frontdelivered thin-bedded slit-fine sandstone deposits, these conditions
allow development of tight formations with high-quality source
rocks interbedded with or close to thin-bedded silt-fine sandstones
as well as close contact between source and reservoir; (3) Gravity
flow depositional environment associated with disturbance of
deep-lake sags or slope areas, which are located in the center of
hydrocarbon-generating sags where gravity flow deposits are in
direct contact with source rocks.

According to tight reservoirs and tight oil systems mentioned
above, tight oil in China can be classified into three types:
(1) tight oil in lacustrine carbonate reservoirs that are mainly
composed of dolomite, dolomitized rocks, shell limestone, algal
limestone, and argillaceous limestone; (2) tight oil in deep-lake
delta sandstone reservoirs that are mainly thin-bedded sand-mud
deposits from delta-front and prodelta; (3) tight oil in deep-lake
gravity flow sandstone reservoirs that consist mainly of sanddominated hummocky mixed deposits formed by sandy debris
flows and turbidity currents.

3.2 Basic characteristics of tight oil in lacustrine
carbonate rocks
Carbonate deposits are mainly developed in shallow waters
of lacustrine basins, exclusive to depositional environment of
continental debris but closely related to that of evaporites. The
carbonate deposits were clearly controlled by changes in palaeo-

4

climate, palaeo-hydrodynamics, and palaeo-water chemistry. Major
types of rocks developed in carbonate depositional system included
biogenic limestone, algal limestone, argillaceous limestone,
dolomite, and dolomitized rocks. In China, lacustrine carbonates
were mainly developed in the Permian, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and
Paleogene. The Permian lacustrine carbonate rocks are mainly
distributed in the Junggar and Santanghu basins and dominated
by salinized lacustrine basin deposits of dolomite and dolomitized
rocks. The Jurassic lacustrine carbonate rocks are mainly developed
in the Sichuan and Ordos basins. The Cretaceous lacustrine
carbonate rocks are mainly distributed in the Songliao and Jiuxi
basins. Lacustrine carbonate rocks that were widespread in the
Paleogene, were developed in several other basins in southern
China, e.g., the Hengyang Basin, Sanshui Basin, and Baise Basin.
Formation of continental high-quality hydrocarbon source rocks
was closely related to salinization of relevant lacustrine basins(Zhao,
1992). In the Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental basins such as
Songliao, Bohai Bay, Ordos, Qaidam, Jianghan, Subei, and Pearl
River Mouth basins, high-quality source rock deposition (except
for coal measure deposition) was exclusively related to salinization
in lacustrine basins(Jin et al., 2008). In these regions, organicrich source rocks (TOC>l%)
co-exist with carbonate, sulfate, or
100
chloride minerals to different extents, and sometimes high-quality
95
source rocks are interbedded with carbonate-rich or gypsum-salt
beds. These are favorable75 conditions for tight oil development in
lacustrine carbonate rocks.
25

With respect to lithology of tight oil-bearing lacustrine carbonate
5
rocks, salinized lacustrine dolomite and dolomitized rocks within
dark shale of semi-deep to0 deep lake facies and buried at moderate
depths (generally <3500 m) are the most favorable tight oil
reservoirs. The salinized lacustrine dolomite and dolomitized rocks
are widely distributed in sags and slope areas. To date, this type of
tight oil has been found in the Permian strata of the Junggar and
Santanghu basins, the Cretaceous strata of the Jiuxi and Jianghan
basins, and the Paleogene strata of the Qaidam and Bohai Bay
basins, among these, the Permian Lucaogou Formation in the
Junggar Basin is the most typical tight oil reservoir.
Tight oil in the Lucaogou Formation was first discovered in
the mid-1980s(Wang et al., 2002). The Lucaogou Formation
are composed of gray mudstones, silt-fine sandstone, dolomite,
dolomitized rocks and oil shale, and mainly distributed in the
Bogda Piedmont and the Jimusaer sags on the southern margin
of the Junggar Basin. The maximum thickness in the outcrop
area is up to 985 m(Wang, 1998). The depositional environment
of Lucaogou Formation is the continental margin offshore
lacustrine, which generally developed salinization symbols such
as gypsum crystals and palaeo-cod fish-scale fossils(Zhang et
al., 2007). TOC range from 5.16 to 8.03%, chloroform bitumen
“A” are from 0.44 to 0.73%, S1 + S2 vary from 3.50 to 20.98 mg/g,
type of organic matter is sapropel-humics, and Ro are from 0.50
to 1.63%, indicating high quality of source rocks (Table 1).

Lithologically, layer of major tight-oil production in the Lucaogou
Formation consists of silty dolomite, dolomitic siltstone, and
argillaceous dolomite in the lake center and between fans. This
layer is within shale and oil shale, and individual layer and
cumulative thicknesses are around 10–20 m and 80–120 m,
respectively. The rock debris shows a large segment of continuous
fluorescence. Crude oil leakage is commonly observed in the core.
Mud logging gas increases substantially, showing integrity of source
- reservoir and large area of oil-bearing formations (100–1000 km2)
(Fig. 4). High dolomitic content contributes to improvement of
porosity but poses no significant adverse influence on permeability.
Reservoir storage spaces mainly include dissolution pores, interlayer fractures, residual intergranular pores, and nanopores.
Porosity is 2.50–16.27%, permeability is mostly <0.1 mD, and pore
throat diameter is generally 100–500 nm.
Pingdiquan Formation on the northeastern margin, Lower Urho
Formation on the northwestern margin, and Lucaogou Formation
on the southern margin of the Junggar Basin are syndepositional
(Table 1). Depositional environment of Lucaogou Formation
was lacustrine with large area, deepwater and high salinity,
and influenced by seawater. Pingdiquan Formation in the
northeastern margin was less subjected to seawater influence.
A freshwater environment was dominated when Lower Urho
Formation was deposited (Jiao et al., 2007). Four tight oil
favorable blocks have been identified in the Lucaogou Formation

3.3 Characteristics of tight oil in deep-lacustrine
delta sandstones
Deep-lacustrine delta sandstones tight oil is the most widely
distributed in China and has been discovered in the Qingshankou
and Quantou formations of the Songliao Basin, the Shahejie
Formation of the Bohai Bay Basin, the Yanchang Formation of the
Ordos Basin, and the Middle-Lower Jurassic of the Sichuan Basin.
Tight oil of the Gaotaizi reservoir and Fuyu reservoir in the
Songliao Basin, are the typical representatives in China, and
has been discovered in the early 1980s. Main production layers
of tight oil are mainly distributed in the central depression. The
first member of the Qingshankou Formation is the major source
rock with thickness from 60 to 80 meter, which is dominated by
black shale, oil shale, and oil shale interbedded with thin-bedded
argillaceous limestone and ostracoda layer. The distribution area
is >40×103 km2, and burial depth is 1800–2500 m.The kerogen
belong to sapropel type (Type 1). TOC is 0.9–3% (average 2.13%),
and Ro value is 0.7–1.3%. The reservoirs are the prodelta thinbedded silt-fine sandstones of the Qingshankou Formation and
shallow delta sandstone of the Quantou Formation. The fourth
member of the Quantou Formation is mostly favorable strata for
tight gas accumulation, and mainly is developed in the QijiaGulong and Changling sags in the central depression. The overlying
Qingshankou Formation can be divided into the three members,
respectively. The sedimentary environment of the first member
of the Qingshankou Formation was deep to semi-deep lacustrine,
and developed deep-lacustrine delta sandstones, whereas during
the depositional periods of the second and third members of the
Qingshankou Formation, the lacustrine shrank, leading to poor
development of deep-lacustrine delta sandstones. Ratios between
sandstone thickness and strata thickness of the Qingshankou
Formation is generally 10–35%, major reservoir storage spaces
are residual intergranular pores, dissolution pores, and nanopores.
The distribution area of tight oil in the Qingshankou-Quantou
Formations is approximately (15–20)×103 km2.

3.4 Characteristics of tight oil in deep-lacustrine
gravity flow sandstones
Gravity flow sand bodies are widely developed in the Mesozoic

5

C. Jia et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,1-9

and Cenozoic continental basins in China and can be divided
into three types, i.e, sandy debris f low deposits, classic
turbidites, and slump deposits. The sandy debris flow deposits
are the most widely-distributed type of gravity flow sand
bodies, and due to high density of fluid, it is often distributed
in slope zones of basin with irregular tongue shape, the sand
bodies are continuous. Classic turbidites constitute a relatively
small proportion in the gravity flow deposits, due to low fluid
density, it can extend to plain areas of the basin, fans with water
channels on the plain are the main difference from sandy debris
flow deposits, sand bodies occur as isolated lenticular or thinbedded sheet-like shapes(Zou et al., 2009). Slump deposits are
deformable formations developed in the deep-water environment
due to sliding and/or slumping, it is mixed with sand and
mud, resulting in poor sorting. Extensive core observations
demonstrate that hydrocarbon potential of the sandy debris flows
deposits is best (oil-saturation) because of continuous and large
thickness of sand bodies; only hydrocarbon potential of unit A
of the Bouma sequence in the classic turbidites are better (oilrich or oil-immersed) because of sand-mud rhythmic; the slump
rocks have poor oil potential (oil spots or traces) (Li et al., 2010).
Deep-lacustrine sandy debris flow and turbidity current deposits
are the major types of tight oil reservoirs, which are distributed
in the central part of hydrocarbon-generating sags and are
directly contact with source rocks, thus favoring formation of
large-scale tight oil reserves.
Tight oil in deep-lacustrine gravity flow sandstones has been
identified in the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin and
the Shahejie Formation in the Bohai Bay Basin. The sixth and
seventh members of the Yanchang Formation (T3c6 and T3c7) are

the most representative examples for this reservoir type (Fig. 5).
Tight oil in deep-lacustrine gravity flow sandstones of the T3c6
and T3c7 was first discovered in the mid-1980s. The sandstones
are generally 5–25 m thick, mainly characterized by fine and
very fine sandstones. Pore throats are small, and major reservoir
storage spaces are residual intergranular pore, dissolution pore,
and intercrystalline pore. Porosity is 4–10%, and permeability
is generally <0.3 mD. During deposition of T3c7, the lacustrine
experienced the maximum flooding period and developed
large areas of sandy debris flows deposits and turbidity fan
sand bodies in the center and slope zones. During deposition
of the T3c6, with a gradual shrink of the lacustrine, the erosion
surface continued to fall and the denudation of sediment source
provenance continuously increased, therefore, delta-front
sand bodies commonly underwent gravity slumping (Li et al.,
2011). In the late Triassic, tectonic activities of the surrounding
areas, such as volcanism and earthquake, are intense, favoring
development of gravity-f low deposits. Thin-bedded and
laminated tuff can be found in the T3c6 and T3c7, the thickness
of individual layers are 0.3–40 cm, and commonly are within
sandy debris flows deposits or turbidite sand bodies (Qiu et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2011). Synsedimentary
m icro-fractures associated with ea r thqua ke activities,
earthquake fractures dominated by extensional fractures, and
earthquake-induced breccia are observed in the cores (Li et al.,
2008).
Major source rock in the Ordos Basin is the seventh member
of the Yanchang Formation, with TOC of 13.75%, mean
hydrocarbon-generating potential of 43.58 mg/g, mean

chloroform bitumen A content of 0.896%, hydrogen index (HI)
of 200–400 mg/g, major kerogen of Type II1, and Ro values of
0.7–1.6%. Oil generated from the seventh member undergowent
short-distance migration and accumulated in the deep-lacustrine
gravity flow sandstones of the T 3c6 and T3c7, and formed the
most representative tight oil resources in China. Presently, a
total tight-oil-bearing area in the T 3c6 and T 3c7 of the Ordos
Basin is approximately 1.2×10 3 km 2 . Efficient large-scale
development has been achieved in this area, and tight oil has
become an important resource for crude oil production.

4 Development potential and strategic
significance of tight oil in China
4.1 Resource potential forecast
4.1.1 Assessment methods
Assessment methods for unconventional oil resources such
as tight oil mainly include analog method and statistical
method which are established on the basis of exploration and
development data. The most representative analog method is
the USGS FORSPAN method, the statistical method includes
volumetric estimation method, single-well reserve estimation
method, stochastic simulation method, exploration simulation
method, and oil-gas resource spatial distribution forecast method.
At present, degree of tight oil exploration is very low in China,
resource assessment mainly uses analogy of resource abundance.
Based on some typical tight oil fields, key parameters such as
reserves abundance and oil-bearing area should be evaluated, then
analog method is used to calculate tight oil resources in major basins
in combination with geological conditions of tight oil formation.

4.1.2 Assessment results
Preliminary assessment results show that total tight oil resources
in the major basins in China are (10.67–11.15)×10 9 t (Table
2). Tight oil resources are particularly abundant in the Ordos,
Junggar, Songliao, Bohai Bay, and Sichuan basins. Therefore,
these regions should be key targets for tight-oil exploration in the
future.

4.2 Development prospects
4.2.1 Rrealistic alternative oil resource
Since the 1960s, tight oil has been discovered in the Songliao,
Bohai Bay, Qaidam, Turpan-Hami, Jiuxi, Jianghan, Nanxiang,
Subei, and Sichuan basins in China (Lin et al., 2011). In
the Songliao Basin, the Qingshankou Formation mudstone
reservoirs of Well Da 4 in the Da’an structure yielded 2.66 t/
d, the 10-year accumulative oil production from mudstone
fractured reservoirs in the Xinbei oilfield in the southern area
is >30×103 t. In the Bohai Bay Basin, more than 320 wells
can be found oil and gas shows in mudstones, of which over
30 wells yielded oil and gas flow during well tests, and the
highest single-well production can reach 110 t/d. In the Jiuquan
Basin, low-production oil flow or extensive oil and gas shows
are obtained from shale/mudstone of the Lower Cretaceous in
Huahai sag, and total oil reserves of mudstones in Qingxi sag is
>0.1×109 t. Tight oil in the Triassic Yanchang Formation of the
Ordos Basin, the Permian Lucaogou Formation of the Junggar
Basin, the Cretaceous Qingshankou-Quantou formations of
the Songliao Basin, the Middle-Lower Jurassic of the Sichuan
Basin, and the Shahejie Formation of the Bohai Bay Basin have
been developed in the industrialized production. Tight oil has

now become the most realistic unconventional oil resources in
China.
4.2.2 Technological progress and development direction
Technological advances play a decisive role in the efficient
development of tight oil. The most critical technologies
are horizontal well technology and fracturing technology.
Based on tight oil accumulation patterns in the Ordos Basin,
PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company has focused on key
exploration technologies and successfully achieved largescale exploitation of ultralow-permeability oil reservoirs
(0.3–1 mD) through three-dimensional exploration model
and cluster well group drilling technology. Additionally, the
company has continued to strengthen research on new fields
of tight oil and advance in trials of tight oil exploration and
development technology. Field tests are presently ongoing
in tight oil reservoirs and new progress are achieved in
laboratory research as well as field experiments of tight oil
in the 7th member of Yanchang Formation with very low
permeability (<0.1 mD). The successful exploration of tight
oil in the Ordos Basin provides valuable experiences for
developing direction of tight oil exploration technologies in
other basins in China.
4.2.3 Significance for oil production in the future in China
After over half a century of exploration, with increasing
exploration extent of conventional oil resources in China,
exploration will become more and more difficultly. Some
oilfields are now experiencing period of high water content and
high recovery degree, leading to large difficulties in stabilized
production or increasing production of crude oil. Efficient,
large-scale development of tight oil resources in the Ordos
Basin indicate that tight oil is a very realistic alternative oil
resource, and will play an essential role in China’s crude oil
production through further exploration and development as well
as technological application.

5 Conclusions
(1)In China, tight oil can be defined using following parameter
standards: porosity <10%, permeability <1 mD (in-situ matrix
permeability <0.1 mD), TOC >1%, Ro from 0.6–1.3%, crude oil
density >40°API or <0.8251 g/cm3. Tight oil can be divided into
3 types in terms of porosity, i.e., Type I (porosity 7–10%), Type
II (porosity 4–7%), and Type III (porosity <4%).
(2) In China, tight oil is mainly distributed in the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic continental lacustrine depositional systems and can be
divided into 3 types according to depositional environment and
reservoir lithology, i.e., tight oil in lacustrine carbonate rocks,
tight oil in deep-lake gravity flow sandstones, and tight oil in
deep-lake gravity flow sandstones.

(3) Tight oil has broad exploration prospects in China.
Progressive industrial findings have been achieved in the
Ordos, Junggar, Songliao, Bohai Bay, and Sichuan basins. Total
resources of tight oil in the major basins of China are forecasted
to be (10.6–11.15)×109 t by using analog method for resource
assessment.
(4) The Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin,
the Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Junggar Basin, the
Cretaceous Qingshankou - Quantou Formations in the Songliao
Basin, the Paleogene Shahejie Formation in the Bohai Bay
Basin, and the Middle-Lower Jurassic of the Sichuan Basin are
realistic tight oil exploration areas of tight oil in China.
(5) Tight oil is a highly realistic alternative oil resource, and will
play an essential role in China’s crude oil production through
further exploration and development as well as technological
application.
