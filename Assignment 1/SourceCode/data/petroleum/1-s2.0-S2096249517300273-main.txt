Abstract: Shale gas reservoirs are found all over the world. Their endowment worldwide is estimated
at 10,000 tcf by the GFREE team in the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of
Calgary. The shale gas work and production initiated successfully in the Unites States and extended
to Canada will have application, with modifications, in several other countries in the future. The
‘modifications’ qualifier is important as each shale gas reservoir should be considered as a research
project by itself to avoid fiascos and major financial losses. Shale gas reservoirs are best represented
by at least quadruple porosity models. Some of the production obtained from shale reservoirs is
dominated by diffusion flow. The approximate boundary between viscous and diffusion-like flow is
estimated with Knudsen number. Viscous flow is present, for example, when the architecture of the
rock is dominated by mega pore throat, macro pore throat, meso pore throat and sometimes micro
pore throat. Diffusion flow on the other hand is observed at the nano pore throat level. The process
speed concept has been used successfully in conventional reservoirs for several decades. However,
the concept discussed in this paper for tight gas and shale gas reservoirs, with the support of core
data, has been developed only recently, and permits differentiating between viscous and diffusion
dominated flow. This is valuable, for example, in those cases where the formation to be developed is
composed of alternating stacked layers of tight sands and shales, or where there are lateral variations
due to facies changes. An approach to develop the concept of a super-giant shale gas reservoir is
presented as well as a description of GFREE, a successful research program for tight formations.
The paper closes with examples of detailed original gas-in-place (OGIP) calculations for 3 North
American shale gas reservoirs including free gas in natural fractures and the porous network within
the organic matter, gas in the non-organic matter, adsorbed gas, and estimates of free gas within
fractures created during hydraulic fracturing jobs. The examples show that the amount of free gas in
shale reservoirs, as a percent of the total OGIP, is probably larger than considered previously in the
literature.

Key words: shale gas reservoirs; process or delivery speed; quadruple
porosity model; Knudsen number; pore throat level

1 Introduction
Several researchers (Archie, 1950; Kwon and Pickett, 1975; MacKenzie,
1975; Chopra et al., 1987; Gunter et al., 1997a; Ebanks, 1987; Hartmann
and Beaumont, 1999, Aguilera, 2010) have discussed the importance
of pore and throat structure (for example size, geometry, distribution,

connectivity, and composition) on flow unit and storage capacity of
porous media. Pore throat apertures have been estimated based on
knowledge of process speed, i.e., the ratio of permeability and porosity
(Kolodzie, 1980; Aguilera, 2002). In turn, these pore throat apertures
has been used with reasonable success to anticipate the oil and gas
flow rates that can be expected from a given well (Martin et al., 1997,

Deng et al, 2011). In general, this type of work has been performed in
‘conventional’ carbonate and siliciclastic reservoirs. This paper shows,
with the use of real data and simulation at the pore throat level, that the
same concept can be extended quantitatively to the case of tight gas and
shale gas reservoirs.
Fig. 1 displays location of shale gas reservoirs assessed by the
United States Energy Information Agency (EIA, 2011). The
EIA’s work shows technically recoverable gas resources from

shales in the amount of 6,622 tcf in 32 countries assessed. This
compares with a global (all countries) recovery from shales of
10,000 tcf estimated by the GFREE team. GFREE stands for
an integrated multidisciplinary team researching geoscience
(G), formation evaluation (F), reservoir drilling, completion
and stimulation (R), reservoir engineering (RE), economics
and externalities (EE). Endowment, as used in this paper, is
the summation of cumulative gas production, reserves and
undiscovered gas.

Fig. 2 illustrates a world gas resource pyramid showing global
endowment for conventional gas, tight gas, shale gas and coalbed
methane reservoirs (Aguilera, 2010). The total natural gas
endowment, excluding natural gas hydrates, is gigantic, at 45,000
tcf. The endowment of natural gas, the cleanest burning fossil fuel,
will supply market needs for over 100 years. The pyramid shows
that unconventional gas is associated with very low permeabilities.
As such, successful production of unconventional gas will be
associated with increases in prices, activation indices, research
and time. Activation index (Economides and Oligney, 2000) is a
measure of the total investment required to establish access to new
oil or gas expressed in dollars per unit volume per day (for example,
$/barrel/day or $/Mcf/d) of stabilized production. The pyramid
also shows decreases in process (or delivery speed) and pore throat
apertures, which are some of the key topics discussed in this paper.
Although process speed has been used for several decades in
conventional reservoirs in the oil and gas industry, the proposed
use of this concept for distinguishing between flow units in
conventional, tight gas and shale reservoirs has been developed
only within several years. Comparisons of real data and
theoretical simulations at the pore throat level are consistent and
provide good support to the proposed methodology.

2 Process or delivery speed

been producing for several decades.

Process or delivery speed, i.e., the ratio of permeability and
porosity, provides a relative indication of storage and how
quickly fluids can move through porous media. The concept has
been shown to be powerful for characterizing conventional oil
and gas reservoirs in various lithologies (Chopra et al., 1987;
Gunter et al., 1997b), and for predicting recoverable hydrocarbon
volumes (Pickett and Artus, 1970).

Note that observations on this regard refer to gas rates and
recoveries. For the case of OGIP (Original Gas in Place),
however, Ambrose et al (2010) argue that based on their pore
level observations the volumetric “total gas storage capacities and
the resulting gas-in-place values are being inadvertently inflated
and overestimated.” This study argue the opposite because
historically the large contribution of organic porosity, natural
fractures and hydraulic fractures that contribute a significant
amount of free gas in place has not been taken into account.
And many of the laboratory experiments used for determining
data utilized in computations of original gas in place have been
carried out in crushed samples, which by their very nature do
not generally preserve natural fractures and porosity present in
the organic matter.

It is thus a useful concept for linking geology, petrophysics and
reservoir engineering as permeability and porosity are studied in
detail and used by all of these disciplines (Aguilera, 2004). The
process speed (K/φ) is an important part of the diffusivity equation:

 c p
         (1)
2 p  t
( K /  ) t
where μ is fluid viscosity, cp; ct is total compressibility, 1/psi; and
the term [μct/(k/φ)] is the hydraulic diffusivity (η). The above
equation, for viscous flow, is at the heart of fluid flow calculations
in porous media by reservoir engineers. The same type of equation
but using Fick’s law is applicable for gas diffusion though very
small pores, such as the case of shales. The important of the
process speed is highlighted because, as indicated by Cui et al
(2009), “for a set of experimental data, regardless of the underlying
transfer mechanism, if permeability (K) can be determined, then
the equivalent effective gas diffusivity (ηd) can be calculated” from
the equation ηd = [μct /(K/φ)].

3 Shale gas reservoirs
Shale reservoirs have been considered extensively in the literature
(e.g., Aguilera, 1978; Bustin et al., 2008; Ruppeil and Loucks, 2008;
Wang and Reed, 2009; Ambrose et al., 2010; Lavoie et al., 2010)
and this study has benefitted greatly from those publications. In
particular this section follows closely the work of Aguilera (2010).
In the case of shale gas formations, natural gas is generated in the
shale and remains within the shale. Consequently the shale is both
source rock and reservoir rock. Grains and pores are smaller in
shales as compared with tight and conventional gas formations.
Hydrothermal events may have enhanced the gas potential of shale.
The presence of octahedral pyrite might help explain if these events
took place. Gas is trapped and stored in shale in different ways: (1)
as adsorbed gas into the kerogen material, (2) free gas trapped in
nonorganic inter-particle (matrix) porosity, (3) free gas trapped in
microfracture porosity, (4) free gas stored in hydraulic fractures
created during the stimulation of the shale reservoir, and (5) free
gas trapped in a pore network developed within the organic matter
or kerogen as shown on Fig 3. The latter is a new extraordinary
discovery (Ruppeil and Loucks, 2008; Wang and Reed, 2009) with
significant practical implications that can help explain the larger
than anticipated gas rates and recoveries of natural gas from some
of these formations, for example, in Devonian shales, which have

Furthermore material balance crossplot of p/Z vs G p show an
original straight line which extrapolates to free OGIP followed by a
deviation similar to the response of a gas a reservoir in the presence
of an active aquifer. In the case of shale gas reservoirs, however, the
deviation from the straight line is the result of desorption from the
the tight shale matrix (not the result from water influx).
Fig. 3(a) clearly shows presence of porosity in organic
matter present in the Colorado shale in the Western Canada
Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) (10 μm scale). A similar situation
is observed in the Fig. 3(b) for case of the Barnett shale (1μm
scale). The comparison of shales in 2 different countries
and carried out by different laboratories is mind-boggling.
Furthermore the same type of porosity has been observed in
other shales. The industry is learning about this type of porosity
at this time but the information available suggests that the
pattern may be repetitive and that porosity in organic matter
might be indeed very effective porosity and also very effective
permeability. Observation of images in Fig. 3 at the 10 and 1μm
scales corroborate the presence of organic matter and porosity
within the organic matter. Visual observation of the images
reveal that 1% porosity in the organic matter of shales, as
assumed by Wang and Reed (2009), and used in the example at
the end of this this paper is not unrealistic.
Fig. 4 is a semi-logarithmic crossplot of permeability vs porosity
that includes data from the Horn River Basin and soft shales in
Canada; and Fayettville and Barnet shales in the United States.
Lines for different values of pore throat radii at 35% cumulative
pore volume, rp35 (0.014, 0.025 and 0.04 microns) were developed
with use of the following equation (Aguilera, 2002, 2004):

Kwon and Pickett (1975) for creating a pore structure model and
developing pore structure interrelationships. An interesting and
welcome observation is that the equation also works well for
shales. In fact, lines in Fig. 4 provide a reasonable fit to the shale
data suggesting that there is a continuum of pore throats from
the conventional to the tight gas to shale gas reservoirs.

Nikanassin core plugs (Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous) in
the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, these represent data
from Nikanassin drill cuttings (Solano, 2010). The permeabilities
from drill cuttings are clearly smaller than those from core
plugs. This is the result of destruction of slot porosity and natural
microfractures by the action of the drilling bit. Consequently results
from the evaluation of only drill cuttings (and crushed samples
in shales) in tight gas reservoirs provide pessimistic results viz-aviz evaluations using core plugs and full core analysis. The same
observation hold true when crushed samples of shales are evaluated
in the laboratory, i.e., they provide information only related to the
shale ‘matrix’ while generally ignoring microfractures and the pore
network within the organic material of the shale.

Pore size classes have been grouped by Martin et al (1997) on
the basis of pore throat (port) apertures as megaports (rp35>10
μm), macroports (2.5-10μm), mesoports (0.5 to 2.5μm),
microports (0.1 to 0.5μm), and nanoports (0.01 to 0.1μm). Even
smaller pore sizes are found in shale reservoirs as shown in this
paper. These port sizes can be used for distinguishing flow units
in conventional, tight and shale gas reservoirs.

the data are shown on Figs. 4 and 5 is a good example of the
continuum between conventional, tight and shale gas reservoirs
suggested in this paper. In spite of this observation, the results
have to be used carefully taking into account that there is not a
definitive way and/or standard protocol for determining porosity
and permeability from shale cores.
Fig. 6 is a repeat of Fig. 5 but also includes average porosities
and permeabilities of tight gas formations in Middle East and
North African (MENA) countries (Shehata et al., 2010). Based
on this result the potential of MENA countries per equivalent
well should be comparable to that of North America. The graph
also suggests that it will be difficult to escape from the necessity
of low spacing required to drain efficiently these types of
reservoirs. Fig. 6 also includes data from Wang and Reed (2009).
The crushed samples show permeabilities much lower than all
the other samples. The same holds true for Delaware Barnett

3.1 Quadruple porosity model for shales

(4)

where (φx) is the matrix porosity of the crushed sample without
natural fractures and without organic porosity. The concept
of “container” for the quadruple porosity system can be used
in this case. A container is a reservoir subdivision defined by
correlating flow units between wells (Hartmann and Beaumont,
1999). It consists of a pore system, made up of one or more
flow units that respond as a unit when fluid is withdrawn. The
stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in gas shales is associated
with the hydraulic fracture porosity (φhf ). However, it is likely
that the SRV might be fed by the other porosities considered in
this study, including porosity in the organic matter of the shale.
Equations
3 and 4 are related to the organic porosity ratio,

25
coefficient
(or fracture porosity ratio), fraction; v hf is hydraulic
fracture porosity ratio; vf is portion of total porosity in organic
5
porosity,
natural fractures and hydraulic fractures.
The0 organic porosity ratio indicates what portion of the
total shale porosity is contributed by the organic (kerogen)
porosity. This type of porosity “behaves like high gas content
microfractures” (Wang and Reed, 2009). The partitioning
coefficient (v) indicates what portion of the total porosity is
made out of fractures. The hydraulic fracture porosity ratio (vhf )
indicates what portion of the total porosity is created by the

R. Aguilera./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,10-26

hydraulic fracturing job. This is associated with the stimulated
reservoir volume (SRV). The summation of the three ratios
mentioned above is equal to vf.
Based on petrographic descriptions, at discovery the shale is
actually a triple porosity system made out of porosity in the
organic matter, porosity in the inorganic matter and natural
fractures. However production cannot be obtained from this
system unless it is hydraulically fractured. When additional
space is created via the fracturing job natural gas moves into
the new space and as a result fluid pressure drops. This is the
pressure that is reflected in the gas formation volume factor
(B gi) considered in this study. As a result for the purpose of
volumetric calculations, it is probably more accurate to consider
the reservoir as a quadruple porosity reservoir. The reasoning
is akin to a reservoir that undergoes repeated stages of natural
fracturing through geologic time. At each fracturing stage, the
hydrocarbons spread thought larger pore volumes resulting in an
under-pressured reservoir. However, if the evaluator prefers not
to use the concept of storage within the hydraulic fractures, the
approach presented in this paper can still be used assuming that
φhf is equal to zero.
The practical implications of Wang and Reed’s work (2009)
are enormous and are highlighted in Table 1 that shows in
lines 1 to 8 the same data presented in their paper for the
Barnett, Marcellus and Haynesville shales. The table also
shows some additional assumptions and calculations, which
can be easily reproduced using equations 3 to 5 and some other
basic reservoir engineering concepts as shown on Example 1.
Obviously the assumptions can be changed as needed in order to
evaluate specific areas within a given play. But there are some
important messages in this table. For example, line 9 shows
that the porosity with natural fractures, hydraulic fractures and
within the organic matter is significant (1.7, 1.9 and 1.7% for the
Barnett, Marcellus and Haynesville shales, respectively). These
values compare with a free gas porosity of 1.4% calculated for
the Utica shale over 30 years ago (Aguilera, 1978). The Utica
free gas porosity does not include porosity of the hydraulic
fractures.
The calculated porosity of the crushed samples (φx) in line 10
of Table 1 can be compared, in practice, with crush porosity
laboratory results. The fractions of the total porosity made out
of organic materials porosity, natural fractures and hydraulic
fractures (lines 11 to 13) are very important and add up to
34.00, 29.23 and 14.17%, respectively (line 14). For some basic
assumptions of temperature (line 15), reservoir pressure (line
16), initial water saturation within the free fluid porosity (line
18), and initial water saturation of the total composite system
(line 19), it is possible to calculate in line 20 the volumetric
free original gas in place at reservoir conditions (hydrocarbon
pore volume in matrix, fractures and hydraulic fractures), the

volumetric free gas original gas in place at standard conditions
(line 21), the volumetric total original gas in place (line 22),
and the gas in place in the matrix (line 23). These calculations
indicate, for the assumptions made above, that the percentage
of volumetric free gas in the Barnett is close to 49%, 42% in
the Marcellus and 20% in the Haynesville. The balance is in
the matrix system. And this is without taking into account the
volume of adsorbed gas. These approximate results suggest that
the future of these reservoirs and many other types of shales in
North America and the rest of the world is, in all probability,
brilliant. A detailed procedure for these calculations is presented
in the example at the end of this paper.

3.2 Knudsen number
A no slip boundary condition has been assumed generally in the
past with reasonable results when dealing with conventional gas
reservoirs. However as we move towards gas production from
tight and shale reservoirs, this assumption is no longer valid.
To handle the problem in a rigorous manner to a high level of
accuracy, we could perform flow simulation at a molecular scale
(for example, molecular dynamics (MD) and lattice Boltzman).
The problem, from a practical point of view, is that this
approach is computationally too expensive. A reasonable, yet
accurate, compromise is to represent the slip boundary gas flow
by a diffusion-like mechanism. A commonly acknowledged
parameter to distinguish between diffusion-like flow and
viscous flow, based on Navier-Stokes equation, is Knudsen
number (Kn) (Javadpour, 2007; Rahmanian et al, 2010). Knudsen
dimensionless number is defined as the ratio of the gas mean
free path (λ) and pore diameter (d):

Kn 


d

(6)

where,



kBT
2 2 p

(7)

In the above equations, λ is gas mean free path; d is pore
diameter, m; k B is Boltzmann constant, 1.3805×10 -23 J/°K; T
is the temperature, °K; p is the pressure, Pascal; and δ is the
collision diameter of gas molecule, m (Heidemann et al., 1984).
This equation is not very accurate at high pressure. The Knudsen
number is inversely proportional to the rarefaction encountered
during gas flow through porous media. The larger the pressure,
the smaller is Knudsen number. Also, the larger the pore
diameter, the smaller is Knudsen number. For example for some
conditions, viscous (continuous) flow occurs at Knudsen number
smaller than 0.01, slip flow between 0.01 and 0.1, transition
flow between 0.1 and 10, and free molecular flow (applicable
in shales) at Knudsen numbers larger than 10 (Karniadakis et
al, 2005). Some authors (e.g., Civan, 2009) suggest that viscous
flow occur at Kn smaller than 0.001.

3.3 Simulation at the pore throat level
All interpretations for shale gas reservoirs discussed previously are
based on laboratory measurements of porosity and permeability,
and rp35 values calculated with the use of empirical equation 2.
On the other hand Fig. 7 shows theoretical values of porosity
and permeability obtained from pore scale modeling. The
corresponding rp35 radii in the graph range between 1-4, 0.1-1.5,

16

0.005-0.5 and 0.009-0.1μm (Rahmanian et al, 2010). The pore scale
simulation was performed using software developed by the Imperial
College Consortium on Pore-scale Modelling for regular lattice
systems of high porosity and permeability. From a strict point of
view, the simulations only provide an approximation for tighter
rocks. However, the theoretical data fit very well the empirical flow
units as shown on Fig. 7. Ultimately, in order to squeeze as much
information as possible from pore scale modeling, all equations will

R. Aguilera./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,10-26

have to be calibrated with direct sources of information provided by
cores and drill cuttings.

4 Continuum between conventional, tight
and shale gas reservoirs
Fig. 8 presents an integrated crossplot of permeability vs
porosity in semi-logarithmic coordinates. Shown are flow units
for conventional, tight gas and shale gas reservoirs based on
rp35 pore throat values. The letters HR, B and F represent the
Horn River, Barnett and Fayettville shales. Viscous flow is
predominant in conventional and tight gas reservoirs down to
microport size. Diffusion-based flow dominates at the nanoport
scale, which is typical of shale reservoirs. Discussions of
Knudsen number have been presented by Javadpour et al (2007),
Civan (2009), Rahmanian et al (2010) and Rahmanian (2011).

The potential in the use of process speed as part of the flow
unit characterization of unconventional gas reservoirs is being
recognized at present particularly for numerical simulation
purposes. Some efforts along these lines have been put together
recently with a good level of success by Deng (2011).
Additional refinements will be possible with the collection of
more core and drill cuttings data from stacked layers of tight
and shale gas reservoirs, formations with lateral variation
from tight gas to shale gas reservoirs, and simulations with
theoretical models at the pore throat level. The pore throat level
simulations (Fig. 7) compare very well with actual laboratory
data (Fig. 6). The integration of the core laboratory evaluations
and pore throat simulations allow estimating various properties
related to reservoir rocks listed on the upper left hand side of
Fig 8, including (Rahmanian et al., 2010, Rahmanian, 2011): (1)
Porosity, permeability and pore throat apertures. It is possible
to estimate one of these properties if the other two are know.
The objective can also be achieved with the use of equation 2.
(2) Relative permeabilities and capillary pressures. Information
related to these properties for unconventional gas reservoirs
is very scarce. Simulations at the pore throat level carried out
so far provide reasonable results for relative permeabilities
and capillary pressures when compared with laboratory data
(Rahmanian et al., 2010). (3) Electrical properties. Values of the
porosity (cementation) exponent “m” and the water saturation
exponent “n” are also scarce but play an important role in
calculations of water saturation in tight gas reservoirs. Estimates
of “m” obtained so far compare reasonably well with some
core results available in the literature. Values of “n” have been
obtained from simulations at the pore throat level (Rahmanian
et al, 2010). At present we are researching values of “m” and “n”
in the laboratory. (4) Rock mechanics. The modeling also allow
estimating some geomechanical properties, such as Poisson’s
ratio (PR), shear or rigidity modulus (G), and Young modulus (E),
from which it is possible to make preliminary estimates of pore
pressures and net stress (Rahmanian et al., 2010).
With100
the above information, some preliminary answers can be
provided to the list with the question marks in the lower half of
95
the left hand side on Fig. 8. This however is not meant to replace
detailed
laboratory tests. (1) Brittle or ductile? In general, the higher
75
Young’s modulus and the lower the Poison’s ratio the more brittle
is the rock. (2) Type of stimulation? Geomechanical data from the
micro simulation and history of hydraulic fracturing in the area can
lead 25
to optimized jobs in low permeability formations (Leguizamon
and Aguilera, 2011). (3) Effect of water saturation, mud filtrate
and 5leak-off on embedment? The softer the rock and the higher
the water saturation, the bigger the problems associated with
0
embedment. In hard rocks, embedment is generally limited to 50%
of the grain size. In softer rocks, however, it can be much bigger
(Lacy et al., 1998).

Fig. 8 Integrated crossplot of permeability vs porosity showing flow units for conventional, tight
gas and shale gas reservoirs based on rp35 pore throat values. Viscous flow is predominant in
conventional and tight gas reservoirs down to microport size. Diffusion-based flow dominates at the
nanoport scale, typical of shale reservoirs (Rahmanian et al., 2010). Estimated oil and gas rates for
different port sizes are shown in the right hand size of the graph (Deng et al., 2011).

Fig. 9 shows again an integrated crossplot of permeability vs
porosity. In this case, however, the flow units for conventional,
tight gas and shale gas reservoirs are based on process (or delivery)
speed (K/φ). The concept has also been used in the past for
investigating possibility of CO2 injection in the WCSB Cardium
formation (Dashtgard, 2008) and is being investigated at present for
possible CO2 injection in low permeability formations. The big red
circle at the bottom of the graph shows an average value of porosity
and permeability quoted by Leiker (2008) for the Muskwa shale
(Horn Rover Basin, Canada). Like in previous cases, the integrated
flow unit crossplot of permeability vs porosity appears to generally
provide consistent results. Furthermore, the integrated flow unit
crossplot and analysis is valuable, for example, in those cases

where the
formation to be developed is composed of alternating
201��10�28��17�07�5�
stacked layers of tight sands (for instance the Mesozoic Nikanassin,
Cadomin, and Gething Formations) and shales or in cases where
there is lateral variation from tight to shale gas (for instance the
Triassic Montney in the WCSB).

4.1 Creating a giant undeveloped shale model
The shale gas resource base throughout the world is gigantic.
The GFREE research team has estimated a conservative shale

18

gas endowment of 10,000 tcf. How it is possible to create a giant
shale gas model will be discussed in this study.
The Utica shale in Quebec, Canada was evaluated as a naturally
fractured reservoir over 30 years ago (Aguilera, 1978). The free
OGIP was estimated at 5 bcf per section (1 section = 640 acres).
The technology at the time allowed estimating an average fracture
porosity of 1.4%. This is similar to some of the fracture porosities
estimated by Wang and Reed (2009) for the Barnett (1.5%),
Marcellus (1.7%) and Haynesville (1.2%) shales, without including
porosity of hydraulic fractures. Furthermore, it was estimated that
an average hydraulically fractured vertical well could recover about
2.5 bcf over a 20-year period. The study concluded that a 50% rate
of success in the proposed 90 wells would lead to a breakeven point.
A larger rate of success would result in net profits for the company.
Although extremely important for the province of Quebec these
shales represent only “the tip of the iceberg” as will be shown next.
Fast forward 30 years. The Unites States Geological Survey
(USGS) is examining the potential of oil and gas shales in the
Appalachian Basin with emphasis on the Utica-Lower Paleozoic
total petroleum system. Ryder (2008) indicates that “based on
black shale reservoirs in the Utica shale of the St. Lawrence

Super-giant as it is, the biggest potential prize is not the
Marcellus but the extension of the Utica shale investigated in
Quebec more than 30 years ago. This is represented by the green
color in Fig. 10. The top of the Utica shale is represented by the
blue line in Fig. 10. Note that the thickness of the Utica is much
bigger than the thickness of the Marcellus.
Another point is that there are many instances when basement
rock is naturally fractured. It would be not a surprise if that is
the case of the basement shown in the Fig. 10. When natural
fractures are created in the basement, the dilatancy zones
act as vacuums that tend to suck whatever fluids are in the
surroundings. The Utica shale is an important source rock.
Chances are that significant volumes of Utica gas were sucked
into the basement, if naturally fractured.
The planar surface area where these shales are located is
gigantic. For example, point B in the cross section in the the
Fig. 10 is located in the State of Pennsylvania, which has a
surface area of 119,283 km2. Pennsylvania is also shown in the
left hand side of the graph. Notice that the Utica shale extends
for an area approximately 3 times the size of Pennsylvania.

investigating the possibility of CO 2 disposal in conventional
and/or unconventional reservoirs including shales. The big red
circle at the bottom shows an average value of porosity and
permeability quoted by Leiker (2008) for the Muskwa shale
(Horn Rover Basin, Canada).

Lowlands of Quebec (Aguilera, 1978), a hypothetical Utica
shale reservoir is proposed in this report for the United States
parts of the Appalachian Basin.” In the same year, Lavoie et al
(2008) of the Geological Survey of Canada state that “the entire
Utica Group might reach 300 m in thickness (Aguilera, 1978)
and represents the thickest and most widespread of the Lower
Paleozoic black shale source rock intervals (Ryder et al., 1998).”
The USGS in its Assessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas
Resources of the Appalachian Basin Province calculated that the
Marcellus shale contains an estimated undiscovered resource
of about 1.9 trillion cubic feet of gas (Milici et al., 2002). This
estimated volume is within the yellow contour line (inside the green
shade) of the map presented in the Fig. 10. The top of the Marcellus
shale is represented by the black line in the right hand side of Fig.

The GFREE research program developed at the Schulich School
of Engineering, University of Calgary, has been discussed in
several venues (Aguilera and Harding, 2007; Aguilera et al.,
2008; Aguilera and Harding, 2011). Given the gigantic volume
of technically recoverable gas from shale reservoirs is shown
on Fig. 2 (10×103 tcf), actively pursue research and development
of this resource were recommend. The economic and technical
100
challenges involved in commercialization
of this vast untapped
resource are many and overcoming them will depend on a
95
multi-disciplinary approach involving geoscience, engineering
and economics. A sample of GFREE
75 contributions towards the
achievement of this goal are presented next.
The cornerstone of the whole project is the proper geoscience (G)
understanding of shale gas reservoirs.
For example, assuming
25
that all shale gas formations are equal can lead to significant
financial losses and major fiascos. 5As a result, we recommend
treating each shale gas reservoir as an individual and separate
0
project. Understanding the rocks and the regional variability of
fracture distribution, mineralogy and diagenesis is fundamental
to this research. Fulfilling this step involves working in close
cooperation with geoscientists in industry, universities and
research organizations throughout the world; and performing
the work at several scales, from a micro scale (Fig. 3) to a macro
scale (Fig. 10).

States (King, 2011). There is also potential in the basement, if naturally fractured, as the formation of
natural fractures creates a vacuum that would suck the fluids (natural gas) in the surroundings

The well testing part of the formation evaluation effort
endeavors to develop better methods for estimating permeability,
skin and fracture length, using models that include the known
existence of matrix, natural fractures and porosities within
the organic material of the shale. Although methods for
estimating these properties are mature and well established for
conventional reservoirs, when it comes to unconventional gas
reservoirs,
the methodology is not well developed due to the
Fig.10
very
low permeability of these types of formations. An example
201��10��1����5��07
of pressure response in a triple porosity reservoir is shown on
Fig. 11.
The next segment of our research is associated with the
reservoir; how to access it, how to complete wells in it and how
to stimulate the wells. The key ideas are intercepting natural

20

fractures, not damaging the fractures and developing the correct
hydraulic fracturing procedure. Examples of drilling and
hydraulic fracturing optimization in the WCSB are presented in
presented in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively.

involves detailed mineralogy and thermal maturity studies of
shale gas formations. Similarly a robust quick-look complement
is required as the detailed studies, including cores, are
performed typically in a small percentage of the wells. This
segment also attempts to develop dual, triple and quadruple
porosity petrophysical methods capable of handling fractures,
porosities in the organic material of shales and matrix porosities,
as discussed previously in this paper. One of our triple porosity
models have been used successfully in a carbonate reservoir in
Tarim Oilfield in China (Liu et al., 2009). From the formation
evaluation results, we can attempt to generate “rules of thumb”
that will provide initial estimates of gas production rates
from wells drilled in different types of rocks. An example is
provided in the right side of Fig. 8, potential oil and gas rates are
presented for different port sizes.

The reservoir engineering (RE) segment includes an estimation
of the resource base in shale gas reservoirs, volumetric (Table
1) and material balance evaluations and determinations of
the optimum well spacing. This approach is supplemented by
production decline analysis. A response example for a model
that considers a multi-stage hydraulically fractured horizontal
well is presented in Fig. 14. The theoretical response is similar

The GFREE research program also keeps an eye on the triple
bottom line. Our idea is to research only those items that present
good probabilities of generating positive cash flows and being
economic (the first E in the acronym). Technological innovations
presumably will lead to reductions in capital and operating costs.
These innovations have to be supplemented by environmental
and social considerations, i.e., sound externalities (the last E in

knowledge of tight and shale gas formations, and that are needed
by industry and research organizations worldwide. Evaluating
the current status of geologic models, reservoir characterization,
recovery and production technologies currently available for
these types of formations is the first step in the effort to reach
the final goal, finding economic means of producing as much of
this gas as possible. In progress GFREE research indicates that
many of the methods we are developing have also application in
tight oil reservoirs.

4.3 Example for calculating Gas-In-Place in shale
gas reservoirs
This example uses data of the Barnett shale, published originally
by Wang and Reed of the Bureau of Economic Geology and
the University of Texas (2009), and represented by asterisks
(items 1 to 8) in the first column of Table 1. The shale porosity
(φ sh) is 0.05. Wang et al assumed natural fracture porosity
(φ2) and hydraulic fracture porosity (φhf ) are 0.005 and 0.002,
respectively. Their observations indicate 0 to 25% porosity in
the Barnett organic matter (φ TOC). Consequently they assume
a reasonable intermediate value φ TOC = 0.1. Furthermore
their total organic content by weight (TOCwgt) is 0.05. This
is equivalent to approximately 0.1 total organic content by
volume (TOCvol). This leads to a porosity of organics in shale
(φorg), as a function of the bulk volume of the shale equal to
TOCvol×φTOC = 0.1×0.1 = 0.01, which is shown for the Barnett
in item 7 of Table 1. The total porosity with free gas (φf ) in
the organic, natural and hydraulic fractures is consequently
(φ org)+(φ 2)+(φ hf ) = 0.010+0.005+0.002 = 0.017. The porosity
in the rock matrix (φm) is then equal to 0.033 as shown in row
8. Based on past experience, it is reasonable to assume that the
initial water saturation if the fractures and the organic matter
(Swif ) is equal to zero. On the other hand, the water saturation in

22

the nonorganic matrix (Swim) can be much larger than zero, as
explained later. Assuming that all the constituents of free gas
porosity in fractures and the organic material are not present in
a crushed sample leads to a crushed porosity shown on row 10,
φx=0.033/(1-0.010-0.005-0.002)=0.0336 calculated with the use
of equation 5. The fractions of the total shale porosity made out
of organic porosity, natural fractures and hydraulic fractures,
shown on rows 11 to 13, are calculated from equation 6 as
follows: vorg= 0.01/0.05 = 0.2, v = 0.005/0.05 = 0.1, vhf = 0.002/0.5
= 0.04. This indicates that the fraction of the total porosity filled
with free gas in organic, natural and hydraulic fractures (vf ) is
a significant 0.017/0.5 = 0.34 as shown on row 14. Rows 15 and
16 present the assumed reservoir temperature and pressure. The
pressure reflects the fact that gas has already expanded into
the hydraulically fracture system. Without this expansion the
pressure would be somewhat higher. Row 17 is a gas formation
volume factor (0.00419 cf/scf) based on the above assumed
pressure and temperature. Rows 18 and 19 show assumed
water saturation (Swif = 0) in the organic, natural and hydraulic
fractures; and the water saturation in the composite quadruple
porosity system (Swi= 0.3), respectively.
Free gas in place in the organic, natural and hydraulic fractures
in reservoir cubic feet per acre ft is calculated volumetrically
OGIPvf = 43,560×0.017×(1–0) = 740.67 as shown in row 20. At
standard conditions the volume is equal to 740.67/0.00419 = 177
Mscf/acre ft as shown on row 21. The total original gas in place
is calculated volumetrically OGIPvt = 43,560×0.05×(1–0.3) =
364 Mscf/acre ft as shown in row 22. The difference between
the 2 previous volumes gives the original gas in place in the
nonorganic matrix OGIPvm = 187 Mscf/acre ft as shown on row
23. Row 24 shows that for this Barnett example, 48.57% of the
total original free gas in place is within
the network of organic,
100
natural and hydraulic fractures where the water saturation is
equal to zero. On the other hand, the95remaining 51.43% is stored
within the nonorganic matrix (row 25).
75

The quadruple porosity system discussed in this paper is
strongly scale-dependent. The same holds true for water
saturation. For example, the water saturation of the composite
25
system (Swi) is 0.30 (row 19). The water
saturation of only the
matrix (Swim) is calculated from:
5

S wi S wim (1  vf )  S wif vf
0

    (8)

Since Swif is equal to zero the resulting matrix water saturation
is 0.30/(1-0.34) = 0.4545 (row 26). Even though the actual
volume of initial water is the same, the water saturation is 0.30
when scaled to the pore volume of the composite system, and
is much larger (0.4545) when scaled to the volume of only the
nonorganic matrix porosity. Note that the OGIPvm calculated as
the difference between total and free gas in organic porosity,
natural and hydraulic fractures (row 23) is the same as the
volume calculated calculated volumetrically for the matrix in

R. Aguilera./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,10-26

row 27, OGIPvm = 43560×0.033× (1-0.4545)/0.00419 = 187 Mscf/
acre ft.
Because the above volumes are calculated volumetrically in
nonorganic rock matrix (φ m), porosity network within the
organic material (φ org), natural fractures (φ 2) and hydraulic
fractures (φ hf ), the adsorbed gas has not yet been taken into
account. So the estimates are probably conservative. Adsorbed
gas can be taken into account for the example at hand based on
knowledge of the apparent natural gas molecular weight, MWa
= 19.10 (row 28), average bulk density, ρ b = 2.55 g/cm 3 (row
29), sorbed phase density, ρs = 0.37 g/cm3 (row 30), Langmuir
storage capacity, G sL = 64.16 scf/ton (row 31), and Langmuir
pressure, pL = 1,200 psi (row 32). These data permit estimating
adsorbed porosity (φa = 0.0085, row 33) from the equation (Cui
et al., 2009; Ambrose et al., 2010):


a 1.318E  06( MWa )

Langmuir data are utilized for calculating the volume of
adsorbed original gas in place (OGIPa = 169 Mscf/acre ft) as
shown in row 34 from:

OGIPa  (GsL

(10)

Free gas is calculated to be 276 Mscf/acre ft in row 35 with with
the use of the equation:



(11)

Where the first term of the right side is equivalent to the total
volumetric original gas in place (OGIPvt = 364 Mscf/acre ft)
shown in row 22 and the second term is the adsorbed gas shown
in row 34.
Total original gas in place (OGIPt) is calculated to be 445
Mscf/acre ft in row 36 as the summation of the adsorbed gas
(169 Mscf/acre ft) and free gas (276 Mscf/acre ft). Thus the
percentage of free gas is significant (62.01%) as shown in row
37.
The procedure presented in this example suggests that the
volumes of OGIPt in shale gas formations presented previously
in the literature might have been conservative as typically they
do not include the independent significant contribution of free
gas in organic matter, natural fractures and hydraulic fractures.
But more importantly, it can be argued that the estimated gas
recoveries might have been conservative in the past as the “gas
permeability in organic matter is significantly higher than in
nonorganic matrix” (Wang and Reed, 2009). The same holds
true for natural fractures. Furthermore, experiments have been
usually carried out in crushed samples, which in all probability

eliminate most of the natural fractures, the larger pores, and
the porous network in the organic matter; leading thus to
conservatively low permeabilities. Also, with advances in
technology, the areas of the shale formation exposed indirectly
to the wellbore by multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have been
increasing continuously.

5 Conclusions
(1) Flow units of conventional, tight gas and shale gas reservoirs
can be estimated from knowledge of process (or delivery) speed.
A new integrated crossplot of permeability vs porosity that
allows distinguishing between flow units in conventional, tight
gas and shale gas reservoirs has been developed.
(2) Process (or delivery) speed represented by the ratio of
permeability and porosity is shown to provide a continuum
between conventional, tight gas and shale gas reservoirs.
(3) Permeabilities from drill cuttings are clearly smaller than
those from core plugs. This is the result of destruction of natural
microfractures by the action of the drilling bit. Consequently
results from the evaluation of only drill cuttings (and crushed
samples in shales) provide pessimistic results viz a viz
evaluations using core plugs and full core analysis.
(4) The approximate boundary between viscous and diffusion
dominated flow is estimated with Knudsen number. Viscous
flow is generally present when the architecture of the rock is
dominated by megaports, macroports, mesoports and sometimes
microports (port = pore throat). Diffusion flow on the other hand
is observed at the nanoport level. This distinction is valuable, for
example, in those cases where the formation to be developed is
composed of alternating stacked layers of tight sands and shales;
or where there are lateral variations from tight gas to shale gas.
(5) Tight gas reservoirs are more realistically represented by
triple porosity models as thin section work shows the presence
of intergranular porosity (in some cases), microfractures and slot
porosity. Shale gas reservoirs are more realistically represented
by a quadruple porosity model, as thin section and geochemistry
work shows the presence of nonorganic matrix porosity, organic
(kerogen) porosity, microfractures, and hydraulic fracture
porosity (associated with the stimulated reservoir volume, SRV).
(6) The volumes of initial free gas in place in shales are probably
larger than those considered in the past, and under favorable
conditions can reach over 50% of the total gas in place. But
more importantly, gas recoveries can be larger than estimated
in the past because permeability of the porosity in the organic
matter and the natural fractures is significantly higher than the
permeability of the nonorganic matter.
(7) There is significant potential in the use of process (or

23

delivery) speed as part of the flow unit characterization of
unconventional gas reservoirs.
