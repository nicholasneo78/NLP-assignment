Abstract: Efficient large-scale development of ultra-low-permeability reservoirs (0.3–1 mD) has
been achieved in the Changqing Oilfield, Ordos Basin of China. According to unique features of
petroleum exploration and development in this basin, tight oil herein refers to petroleum that occurs
in oil-bearing shales and interbedded tight sandstone reservoirs adjacent to source rocks with ambient
air permeability <0.3 mD. Tight oil in tight sandstone and shale have generally not yet experienced
large-scale long-distance migration. In the Yanchang Formation, tight oil has mainly accumulated
in the semi-deep to deep lacustrine facies, typically in oil-bearing shales and tight sandstones of the
7th member oil-bearing formation and tight sandstones of the 6th member oil-bearing formation
in the center of the basin. Tight oil resource in the Ordos Basin is characterized by wide spatial
distribution, excellent source rocks, extremely tight sandstone reservoirs, complex pore throat
structures, poor physical properties, high oil saturation, good crude-oil properties, and low reservoir
pressure. A fundamental feature of the continuous oil and gas accumulation in tight oil reservoirs is
the widespread development of nano-scale pore-throat systems. In the Yanchang Formation, most of
connected pore throats in tight sandstone reservoirs have diameters greater than critical pore throat
diameter, allowing oil and gas migration in the tight reservoirs. According to contact relationship
between tight reservoirs and source rocks, three types of tight oil reservoirs are identified in the
Yanchang Formation, i.e., tight massive sandstone reservoir, sand - shale interbed reservoir, and oilbearing shale reservoir. In the Ordos Basin, tight oil is widely distributed in the 6th and 7th members
of the Yanchang Formation, with total resources estimated to be 3×109 t. These include >1×109 t of
oil resources in shale in the 7th member of the Yanchang Formation and approximately 0.9×109 t
and 1.1×109 t of tight sandstone oil resource in the 6th and 7th members of the Yanchang Formation,
respectively. These tight oil resources are the realistic resources addition for the oilfield, which can
ensure an annual production of 50×106 t of oil and gas equivalent and maintain long-term stable oil
production in the Changqing Oilfield, Ordos Basin, China.

Key words: tight oil; tight sandstone reservoir; shale reservoir;

1 Introduction
Tight oil is a new hot spot of global exploration and development
of unconventional oil and gas resources following shale gas (Liang
et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011a; Jia et al., 2012a).
Tight oil plays a crucial role in the global energy structure, and
commercial development of tight oil has been achieved in a number
of countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia (Zou
et al., 2011a; Yan et al., Lin et al., 2011). Despite their abundance
in China, exploration and development of unconventional oil and
gas resources remain in an early stage in this country (Guan et al.,
1995; Zou et al., 2010a).
Ordos Basin is rich in tight oil resources and has great potential
for oil exploration and development. Over the past decade,
PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company has overcome
difficulties related to low and ultra-low-permeability and
achieved an annual increase of (1–3)×108 t in proved reserves
for 10 consecutive years. By the end of 2015, the submitted
proved reserves have accumulated to 4.154×10 9 t, including
2.156×109 t in low-permeability reservoirs (<1 mD). Changqing
Oilfield Company has successfully achieved efficient large-scale
development of tight oil reservoirs with ultra-low-permeability
(0.3–1.0 mD) and innovated development technologies, typically
in Huaqing Oilfield. In 2015, crude oil production in Changqing
oilfield exceeded 25×10 6 t. Presently, field research of oil
reservoirs with low permeability of 0.3–1.0 mD is ongoing in
Changqing Oilfield. Laboratory researches and field experiments
are conducted on shale oil in reservoirs of the 7th member of the
Yanchang Formation with permeability <0.1 mD.
To date, there has been no consensus on the definition of tight
oil. Zou et al consider that tight oil is the petroleum that coexists in source rocks and accumulates in various types of tight
reservoirs after short-distance migration, and tight oil reservoirs
mainly consist of tight sandstone and tight limestone, with the insitu matrix permeability less than or equal to 0.1 mD (reservoir
surface-air permeability <1 mD) (Zou et al., 2012a,b). Jia et
al consider that tight oil is the petroleum that occurs in a free
or adsorbed state in source rocks or tight reservoir rocks (e.g.,
sandstone and carbonate rock) interbedded with or adjacent to
source rocks, such oil accumulation has not experienced largescale long-distance migration, and the in-situ matrix permeability
of the reservoirs is less than or equal to 0.1 mD (reservoir surfaceair permeability <1 mD) (Jia et al., 2012b). As for tight oil
represented by Bakken Oilfield in the U.S. (Lin et al., 2011), the insitu matrix permeability of the reservoirs is 0.01–0.1 mD. All the
above definitions of tight oil take the surface-air permeability <1
mD as the boundary. According to actual situation of petroleum
exploration and development in Ordos Basin, reservoirs with
surface-air permeability (herein referred to the permeability in
surface atmosphere unless otherwise specified) <1 mD (in-situ
matrix permeability <0.1 mD) are referred to as unconventional oil

28

and gas resources, and those with the permeability of 0.3–1 mD are
regarded as ultra-low-permeability reservoir. As of date, efficient
large-scale development has been achieved in the abovementioned
low-permeability tight oil reservoirs. To focus on our research
targets, tight oil in Ordos Basin is defined as the petroleum that
occurs in oil-bearing shales and tight sandstone interbed reservoirs
adjacent to source rocks and with surface-air permeability <0.3 mD.
Such oil resources, including tight sandstone oil and shale oil, have
not experienced large-scale long-distance migration. As compared
to the explored low- and ultra-low-permeability reservoirs, tight
oil reservoirs feature complex accumulation mechanisms, fine
pore throats, poor physical properties, and high filling content;
as compared to such resources overseas, tight oil in Ordos Basin
shows substantial differences in pressure coefficient, oil potential,
reservoir brittleness, and natural micro-fracture development.
Consequently, well-developed technologies overseas are not fully
applicable to the exploration and development of tight oil in Ordos
Basin. Based on the latest advances of tight oil exploration in Ordos
Basin, this study elaborates major geological characteristics of tight
oil and preliminarily assesses and forecasts prospects of tight oil
resources in Ordos Basin, in attempt to promote tight oil exploration
and related geological research.

2 Characteristics of tight oil in Ordos Basin
In Ordos Basin, tight oil of the Yanchang Formation has mainly
accumulated in the semi-deep to deep lacustrine facies, typically
in oil-bearing shales and tight sandstones of the 7th member in
the basin and tight sandstones of the 6th member in the center
of the basin. Such tight oil is characterized by wide distribution,
superior hydrocarbon source rocks, tight sandstone reservoir,
complex pore throat structure, poor physical properties, high
oil saturation, good oil quality, and low reservoir pressure
coefficient. Typical oil in the shale is identified in the tight
reservoirs of the 7th member,where oil-bearing shales are
widely distributed with large thickness. Typical tight sandstone
oil is identified in sandstone reservoirs of the 7th member and
reservoirs of the 6th member in the center of the lacustrine
basin. These oil-bearing formations are adjacent to high-quality
source rocks and feature excellent source rock conditions, good
source - reservoir configuration, and tight reservoirs.

2.1 Wide distribution of oil-bearing shales and
high-quality source rocks
During deposition of the Late Triassic Yanchang Formation, the
Indosinian movement led to the formation of a large-scale inland
freshwater lacustrine. During deposition of the 7th member of
Yanchang Formation, the basin reached maximum scale and
developed major source rocks consisting of black shale, and dark
mudstone (Yang and Zhang, 2005; Zhang et al., 20006).
In Ordos Basin, oil-bearing shales mainly are developed in the
lower part of the 7th member. The oil-bearing shales are NW-

H.Yang et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,27-38

SE trending and distributed widely. Their approximate effective
distribution area is 100×103 km, approaching western Yan’an
- An’sai to the northeast, Majiatan to the northwest, Zhenyuan
- Jingchuan to the southwest, and Zhengning - Fuxian to the
southeast (Fig. 1). Source rocks are generally 30–60 m thick, and
maximum thickness is up to 130 m. Hydrocarbon-generating center
lies in the Jiyuan - Huachi - Zhengning area, where distribution
area of high-quality source rocks is approximately 50×103 km2.

Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation, Ordos Basin

Black shales of the 7th member of Yanchang Formation are rich in
organic matter. Organic geochemical data indicate that the residual
organic carbon content of these black shales is generally 6–22%
with the maximum level of 30–40% and the average total organic
carbon (TOC) content of 13.75% (Yang and Zhang, 2005). Organic
maturity (Ro) is 0.85–1.15%, indicating that black shales have entered
the peak stage of oil generation (Yang and Zhang, 2005) and mostly
had undergone intensive hydrocarbon generation and expulsion
(Zhang et al., 2006). Average intensity of hydrocarbon generation is
4.95×106 t/km2, total effective amount of hydrocarbon generation is
247.308×109 t. Average intensity of hydrocarbon expulsion is 2.9×106
t/km2, and total amount of hydrocarbon expulsion is 144.771×109 t.
All the data show that the 7th member of Yanchang Formation has
good-quality source rocks and is an important resource base for
tight oil reservoir.

2.2 Tight sandstone reservoirs and complex pore
throat structure
In the Ordos Basin, tight sandstone reservoirs primarily consist
of continental clastic deposits. The lithology is complex, and
dominated by silt-fine sandstones with fine granularity, poor

physical properties, and tight reservoirs. Generally, porosity
ranges from 4% to 10% and permeability is less than 0.3 mD,
which are typical characteristics of tight sandstones. This
kind of reservoir shows large lateral variations in the physical
properties and features a number of interbeds vertically. Other
characteristics include strong heterogeneity, fine pore throats,
and complex pore structure(Wang et al., 2015a).
In the 6th member of Yanchang Formation, major types of
reservoir rocks are feldspathic sandstone and lithic feldspathic
sandstone. Feldspar content is high, averaging 42.2%; quartz
content averages 25.2%; metamorphic lithic content averages
4.7%. In the 7th member of Yanchang Formation, major types
of reservoir rocks are lithic sandstone and feldspathic lithic
sandstone. Average contents of quartz and feldspar are 32.1%
and 19.6%, respectively; total lithic content is 27.3%, and
dominated by metamorphic lithic debris.
Major reservoir fillings are illite, chlorite, and carbonate. The
fillings accounted for 15.3% of the 6th member of Yanchang
Formation, mainly composed of ferruginous calcite, hydromica,
and chlorite; the ferruginous calcite content is relatively high
and averages 3.8% (30% of total reservoir fillings). The filling
accounted for 17.4% of the 7th member of Yanchang Formation,
mainly composed of illite, chlorite, and carbonate (mainly
ferruginous calcite and ferruginous dolomite); the illite content
is relatively high and averages 7.3% (>45% of total reservoir
fillings). Additionally, reservoir fillings include small amounts
of kaolinite as well as tuffaceous, siliceous, and feldspathic
rocks; illite and ferruginous calcite primarily play a role in
destructing reservoirs by reducing their physical properties,
whereas widespread development of chlorite clay film in a rim
shape effectively improves reservoir properties by exerting a
protective effect on the primary intergranular pores.
In the tight sandstones of the Yanchang Formation, major pore
types are dissolved pore and residual intergranular pore, with
tiny pore throats, complex structure(You et al., 2014), poor
connectivity and intense diagenetic activity. Overgrowth of
quartz and cementation of ferruginous calcite with ferruginous
dolomite are observed commonly, and content of clay matrix
is relatively high. Throat shapes are mainly laminated-,
curved laminated-, and bundled tube-like. Pore throats of tight
sandstone reservoirs have good sorting, mainly in the pattern of
fine pore - micro throat or medium pore - micro fine throat.
Average permeability of tight reservoirs in oil-bearing
formations
100
in the center of the lake basin is <0.3 mD, indicating poor physical
properties. In the 6th member of Yanchang 95
Formation, porosity
of tight reservoirs ranges from 5.6% to15.5% 75(average 10.2%) and
permeability varies from 0.05 to 2.22 mD (average 0.22 mD). In the
7th member of Yanchang Formation, porosity of tight reservoirs is
from 4.8 to 12.6% (average 7.2%) and permeability ranges from 0.01
25
to 1.35 mD (average 0.18 mD).

2.3 High oil saturation and good crude oil quality
In the Ordos Basin, tight sandstones directly contact with highquality source rocks, thus sufficient oil resources and high
charging intensity allow oil and gas generated from source rocks
to form reservoirs by short-distance migration. Tight reservoirs of
both oil-bearing formations have good oil shows, which generally
can be classified as oil-spot to oil-immersion grade by geological
logging. Average oil saturation is up to 70%, specifically, average
oil saturation is estimated to 72.8% by sealing coring, 69.8%
by calculation using the Archie equation, 69.0% by mercury
porosimetry, and 70.3% using infiltration method.
Surface crude oil from the 7th member of Yanchang Formation has
following general properties: density of 0.84 g/cm3, viscosity of 6.12
mPa·s, freezing point of 17. 6°C, and initial boiling point of 76.3°C.
Compared with other oilfields, crude oil from the 7th member of
Yanchang Formation is of good properties in terms of low density,
low viscosity, low sulfur content, and low freezing point.

2.4 Low reservoir pressure coefficients
In the Ordos Basin, major Triassic reservoir depth is generally
1200–2300 m with present stratigraphy pressure of 7.0–18.1 MPa.
Based on analysis of original stratigraphy pressure and reservoir
depth in over 20 developed blocks in the basin, reservoir pressure
coefficient is 0.6–0.8, indicating low pressure of the reservoirs(Li et
al., 2013).
The main reason for formation of low pressure reservoir is that
formation temperature experienced a hot-to-cold geothermal
conversion during oil and gas accumulation (Xu et al., 2012). In

the late Early Cretaceous, the Ordos Basin was influenced by the
Yanshanian tectonic movement, with frequent volcanic activities in
the surrounding areas. During this period, geothermal gradient was
up to 3.5–4.5°C/hm (Ren, 1996), major reservoir depth was up to
3000–4000 m, and therefore, formation temperature could reach
100–180°C. High formation temperature leads to intense fluid
activity and result in kerogen entering mature stage, thus source
rocks began to generate and expulse hydrocarbon. Significant
displacement pressure from hydrocarbon generation and expulsion
allowed oil and gas accumulation in a large quantity, leading to
formation of high-pressure reservoirs. Since the Late Cretaceous,
the Ordos Basin was uplifted and denuded as a whole. According
to recovery of denuded thickness, the denudation could be >1000
m. Pressure of overlying strata decreased while reservoir porosity
rebounded. Meanwhile, magmatic activities in the periphery of
the basin were weakened, whereas the geothermal gradient was
reduced to 2.8–3.2°C/hm and the formation temperature reduced
to 70–100°C (Ren, 1996). The fluid activity was weakened and
pore fluid pressure was further reduced, leading to formation of the
present low-pressure reservoirs.
In the Ordos Basin, tight oil has two key geological characteristics:
(1) source reservoir symbiosis with continuously distribution in
large areas of banded oil-bearing reservoirs, and no obvious trap or
oil-water boundarie, (2) non-buoyant accumulation with continuous
charging of oil and gas, no significant influence by hydrodynamic
effect, and no uniform oil-water interface and pressure system.
Compared with the Bakken Formation in Williston Basin (Table 1)
(Schmoker and Hester, 1983; Webster, 1984; Lin et al., 2011), tight
oil in the Ordos Basin is characterized by large oil-bearing shale
thickness and wide distribution, well development of oil-bearing
shale interbedded with clastic rock favour formation of tight oil and

indicate great development potential of tight oil in this basin.

3.2 Accumulation mechanisms

3 Tight oil distribution patterns and
accumulation mechanisms

Tight oil and shale oil reservoirs are usually dominated by nanoscale pore-throat systems (Zou et al., 2011b). This is a fundamental
pre-requisite for large areas of continuous or quasi-continuous
oil and gas accumulation, which determines the continuous or
quasi-continuous distribution of oil and gas resources (Zou et al.,
2010a; Zou et al., 2012a). Difference between conventional and
unconventional large oil and gas fields is size of pore throat. Pore
throat diameter of conventional reservoirs range from microns to
millimeter, while pore throat diameter of unconventional reservoirs
is generally nanometer-scale. High-resolution field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and nano-CT were
used to investigate pore throats diameters, nano-scale pore throats
(<1000 nm) are widely developed and occupied by petroleum in
the unconventional reservoirs in China, indicating nano-scale
pore throats play an important role in oil and gas accumulation in
unconventional reservoirs (Zou et al., 2012b).

3.1 Distribution patterns
In Ordos Basin, tight oil is mainly distributed in the center of the
Mesozoic large-scale depression lake basin. Oil-bearing shales of
the 7th member of the Yanchang Formation are NW - SE trending
and widely distributed, with relatively large thickness (Fig. 1). The
hydrocarbon-generating center is located in the Jiyuan - Huachi Zhengning area, covering nearly 50×103 km2 of high-quality source
rocks. Tight sandstone oils are primarily distributed in the semideep to deep lake gravity flow sand bodies or delta-front sandstone
bodies. Source-reservoir symbiosis is a major factor to control
accumulation of tight oil (Yao et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016; Zhang
et al., 2016). In the 7th member of the Yangchang Formation, tight
sandstone oils are well developed in the 1st and 2nd sub-members
of the 7th member, and are horizontally distributed in delta-front
sand bodies of the Jiyuan area and turbidite sand bodies of the
Longdong area (Fig. 2a). In the 6th member of the Yanchang
Formation, tight sandstone oils are mainly developed in gravity
flow sand bodies of the semi-deep to deep lacustrine and deltafront sand bodies, and are horizontally distributed in the Huachi,
Qingcheng, and Heshui areas (Fig. 2b).

According to bound water saturation of different samples,
relevant thickness of bound water film are calculated, ranging
from 34-53 nm (average 43 nm) (Xiang et al., 1999). Therefore,
critical pore throat radius that allow asphaltene of maximum
molecular diameter of 4 nm to pass through is 45 nm, that is, the
critical pore throat diameter is 90 nm (Fig. 3).
Statistics of nano-scale pore throat diameter distribution of tight
oil reservoirs in the Ordos Basin shows that median pore throat
diameters of tight oil reservoirs in the Yanchang Formation are
20–300 nm, mainly in the range of 50–200 nm; maximum pore
throat diameters are 300–2000 nm, mainly in the range of 500–
1000 nm(Fig. 4). Pore throat diameter of tight oil reservoirs varies
in different areas. In Jiyuan area, median pore throat diameters of
tight oil reservoirs are 40–300 nm, mainly in the range of 80–200
nm; maximum pore throat diameters are 300–1300 nm, mainly
in the range of 550–1200 nm. In Heshui area, median pore throat
diameters of tight oil reservoirs are 13–300 nm, mainly in the range
of 40–100 nm; maximum pore throat diameters are 300–2000 nm,
mainly in the range of 300–600 nm. In Shangliyuan area, median
pore throat diameters of tight oil reservoirs are 20–300 nm, mainly
in the range of 50–200 nm; maximum pore throat diameters are
300–900 nm, mainly in the range of 500–800 nm.

can be explored and tight oil resources can be used effectively.

4.1 Reservoir types
Evolution of basin controls assemblages of depositional facies
and development characteristics of sand bodies. Delta-front
and gravity flow sand bodies are mainly developed in the 7th
member in the basin and the 6th member in the center of the
basin (Zou et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011), and thick
laminated sand bodies are formed in the center of the lake basin
(Fu et al., 2010). The area of lake basin reached the largest
during deposition of the 3th sub-member of the 7th member
(Yang et al., 2010), then its gradually shrank thereafter. During
deposition of 7th to 6th member of the Yanchang Formation, the
lake basin was dominated by lake regressive - sand trangressive
deposits, and experienced multiple small-scale oscillations,
resulting in fluctuations of the lake level. With oscillations of
the lake basin, the lake underwent periodic trangressive and
regressive processes, leading to deposition of multiple sets
of favorable reservoir-cap rock assemblages of sand - shale
interbeds. Vertical distribution patterns of oil-bearing shales
and tight sandstones in the Ordos Basin shows that tight oil
reservoirs can be divided into 3 major types, including tight
massive sandstone reservoir, sand - shale interbed reservoir, and
oil-bearing shale reservoir (Fig. 5).
Tight massive sandstone reservoirs are mainly distributed in
the middle - upper 7th member and the bottom 6th member of
Yanchang Formation, characterized by multi-stage superposition
of gravity flow slump sandstones with less clay content. The sand
bodies are integral with large thickness, contiguous complex planes
and large scale. Reservoir spaces are mainly dissolved pores and
micro pores (Fig. 6a), with average porosity of 9.5%, permeability
of 0.21 mD and good pore throats connectivity (Fig. 6b).
The sand - shale interbed reservoirs contain a number of interlayers,
which are characterized by multiple sets of superimposed
development of sandstone, silty mudstone, muddy siltstone and
dark mudstone. The reservoirs heterogeneity is strong, with high
clay content, fine grain size, developed micro pores, poor physical
properties (average porosity of 8.1%; average permeability of 0.1
mD) and poor connectivity (Fig. 6c and 6d).
In oil-bearing shale reservoirs, major reservoir spaces are micro
pores and micro fractures in oil-bearing shales. Oil-bearing
shales of the 7th member of the Yanchang Formation are mainly
composed of quartz, feldspar, carbonate, clay and pyrite, with
high content of rigid materials and high quality and abundance
of organic matter. The oil-bearing shales are interbedded with
tuff (Fig. 6e and 6f) and dissolved pores are developed in the
tuff (Fig. 6f). Horizontal micro fractures can be observed in
the oil-bearing shales (Fig. 6e and 6f). The oil-bearing shales

are of certain reserve ability because of micro fractures and its
residual liquid hydrocarbon.

4.2 Exploration progress
Due to poor physical propertie, tight oil reservoirs should be
modified by effective technological measures to achieve industrial
production. In the Changqing Oilfield, process tests that focus on
3 types of tight oil reservoirs have been carried out, and tight oil
reservoirs of massive sandstones, sand - shale interbeds, and oilbearing shales are modified by fracturing, leading to production of
industrial oil flow and new advances in tight oil exploration.
Thick massive tight oil reservoirs of the 7th member of the
Yanchang Formation are fractured by pumping slippery fluid
and surfactant gel and slick mixture fluid in large fluid volume,
large drainage volume with small sand ratio. This process forms
reticular fractures and dramatically expands drainage volume,
thereby improving the single-well production of tight oil. This
technology has been successfully applied in 18 wells in the
Ordos Basin, high-yield oil flow over 20 t are obtained from 5
wells, especially, in the Well H210 (Fig. 5a), high yield of test
oil flow reach to 21.91 t/d after injection of 60.0 m3 of ceramsites
with a sand ratio of 18.5% and a drainage volume of 6.0 m3/min.
For sand - shale interbed and oil-bearing shale reservoirs, Well
L189 and Well G295 are optimised from areas with large thickness
of oil-bearing shales to test. Water injection through oil tube and
casing pipe can increase capacity of fracturing fluid, and then
further expand drainage volume and improve sing-well production.
In the sand - shale interbed reservoirs, ,oil-bearing sandstone
formation in the Well L189 is 4.3 m thick and yield of test oil flow
is up to of 13.18 t/d after injection of 80 m3 sand with sand ratio of
12.4% and drainage volume of 12.0 m3/min (Fig. 5b). In the oilbearing shale reservoirs, oil-bearing shale formation in the Well
G295 is 28.0 thick and yield of test oil flow reaches 20.40 t/d after
injection of 22 m3 ceramsites with sand ratio of 6.3% and drainage
volume of 5.0 m3/min (Fig. 5c).
With technological applications in tight sandstone reservoirs,
a number of large-scale oil-rich zones have been discovered in
the Ordos Basin. Presently, field-testing has been accomplished
in approximately 600 wells for tight sandstone reservoirs of the
7th mumber of the Yanchang Formation. Of these, nearly 350
wells have yielded industrial oil flow and test oil production of
approximately 150 wells are >10 t/d. These wells are mainly
distributed in the gravity flow and delta-front sand bodies in
adjacent hydrocarbon-generating sags, and are mainly spread in
the Longdong and Jiyuan areas; presently, more than 10 largescale oil-rich zones are identified (Fig. 2a), covering total area of
approximately 1400 km2 with implemented reserves >400×106 t
initially. Large-scale reserves of tight oil have been found in the
sandstone reservoirs of the 6th of the Yanchang Formation. The
Huaqing Oilfield is rapidly and efficiently identified based on

integrated exploration and assessment, the proved reserves are
522×106 t. Additionally, 4 large-scale oil-rich zones have been
discovered in the periphery of the Huaqing Oilfield as well as
the Heshui and Ta’erwan areas (Fig. 2b), with controlling area
of 1100 km2 and initial implemented reserves of nearly 600×106,
and the center of the lake basin becomes a favorable target for
tight oil exploration and evaluation.

5 Resource potential
Based on assessment of hydrocarbon source rock and analysis
of tight oil accumulation conditions and mechanisms, some key
indices, such as trap area, reservoir thickness, oil saturation
are used to preliminarily estimate tight sandstone and shale oil
resources with a variety of methods (Guo et al., 2011).

5.1 Tight sandstone oil resource potential
In this study, tight oil resources of Ordos Basin are calculated
using a volume method. This method should use reservoir area and
effective reservoir thickness. Some other parameters for calculation
are derived from blocks of submitted proved reserves.
The equation of the volume method is expressed as:

N  100 Ah So  oTr / Boi

(2)

where N is amount of resources, 104 t; A is the trap area, km2;h is
the oil layer thickness, m; φ is the average effective porosity,%;
S o is the average initial oil saturation,%; ρo is the average
surface crude oil density, t/m3; Tr the success rate of exploratory
wells,%; and Boi is the average initial crude oil volume factor.
Reservoir area (trap area) boundary is generally determined
by both sides of the main sand body, sand body boundaries
of 4- or 10-m-thick oil layers are used as the oil-bearing
boundary, when the oil-bearing boundary is not identified in the
extensional direction of the sand body, the trap area boundary
can be determined by extending the oil flow well with test oil
production >2.0 t or stable oil production >0.65 t by 1–1.5-time
development well spacing. With this method, trap areas of the
7th and 6th members of Yanchang oil-bearing formations are
estimated to be 8461.20 km2 and 4872.54 km2, respectively.
Low limit of effective reservoir thickness is mainly determined
by investigating lithology, oil saturation and physical properties
of the effective reservoir. Low limits of lithology and oil
saturation are identified from core observations, analysis of
physical properties and oil testing results. Empirical statistics
combined with single-layer oil testing data are used to calculate
low limit of physical properties of the effective reservoir. The
average tight oil thickness of 7th and 6th members of Yanchang
oil-bearing formations are 6.0 and 9.3 m, respectively.
The average effective porosity can be obtained by a arithmetic
mean method. The porosity of 7th member of Yanchang oil-

36

bearing formation is generally 5–10% (average 8.1%), the
porosity of 6th member of Yanchang oil-bearing formation is
generally 9–15% (average 11.3%).
The average oil saturation of reservoirs can be obtained by
examining relationship between tight reservoir porosity and oil
saturation from sealing core drilling. The average oil saturations of
7th and 6th members of Yanchang oil-bearing formations are 73%
and 71%, respectively. The crude oil density is used 0.85 t/m3.
The formation crude oil volume factor is 1.341 which is from
the 3rd sub-member of 6th member of Yanchang Formation in
Huaqing area. Risk factor represent degree of implementation
of traps, due to restriction of geological understanding and
exploration degree, exploration of tight oil resources in the
Ordos Basin is still in an early exploration stage, and current
understanding of tight oil accumulation mechanism needs to be
improved. Therefore, recent success rate of exploratory wells is
47.3%.
Results of preliminary assessment show that tight sandstone
resource in Ordos Basin are approximately 2×109 t, including
0.9×109 t of the 7th member of Yanchang oil-bearing formation and
1.1 ×109 t of the 6th member of Yanchang oil-bearing formation.

5.2 Tight oil resource potential in oil-bearing shale
The buried depth of oil-bearing shale in the 7th member of
Yanchang Formation is mostly >1000 m. Tight oil are mainly
developed in 3rd and 2nd sub-members of the 7th member of
Yangchang Formation. Variations of the formation thickness
are very rapid laterally, and single-layer thickness of oil-bearing
shale mainly ranges from 3 to 15 m. The accumulative thickness
of oil-bearing shale in the best developed area is up to 40 m and
ranges from 10 m to 40 m in most areas. The tight oil resources
in oil-bearing shale can be calculated using the following
equation:

(3)
N  GOc Bo
4
where N is the amount of resources, 10 t; G is the weight of
oil-bearing shale, 10 4 t; O c is the content of retained liquid
hydrocarbons, mg(hydrocarbon)/g (oil-bearing shale); and Bc is
the effective oil-bearing shale ratio.

In the 7th member of Yanchang Formation, oil-bearing shale which
accumulative thickness is more than 20 m are distributed in the NW SE direction along the Jiyuan - Huachi - Zhengning area (Fig. 1), with
distribution area of 25×103 km2, average thickness of 11.2 m, density
of 2.21 g/cm3, and weight of 994×109 t. Retained liquid hydrocarbon
content of the oil-bearing shale is generally 1–3 mg/g and averages 2.64
mg/g. Testing results show that oil content >3.5% meets standard of
industrial grade oil. In the 7th member of Yanchang Formation, ratio
of effective oil-bearing shale that meet standard of industrial grade oil
is approximately 40%. Tight oil resource in shale of the 7th member of
Yanchang Formation is estimated to be >1×109 t.

6 Conclusions
(1) In the Yanchang Formation of the Ordos Basin, tight oil
has mainly developed in the semi-deep to deep lacustrine
facies, and has typically accumulated in oil-bearing shales and
tight sandstones of the 7th member of Yanchang oil-bearing
formation as well as tight sandstones of the 6th member of
Yanchang oil-bearing formation in the center of the basin.
(2) Tight oil are characterized by wide spatial distribution,
excellent hydrocarbon source rock conditions, tight sandstone
reservoirs, complex pore throat structures, poor physical
properties, high oil saturation, excellent crude oil quality, and
low reservoir pressure. thus providing favourable geological
conditions for tight oil accumulation and having good producing
potential.
(3) Tight oil reservoirs have median pore throat diameters of
20–300 nm, mainly in the range of 50–200 nm. The maximum
pore throat diameter is 300–2000 nm, mainly in the range of
500–1000 nm. The critical pore throat diameter that meets
requirements of hydrocarbon migration is 90 nm. Diameters
of most connected pore throats of the Yanchang Formation are
greater than this critical value, thereby satisfying requirements
of oil and gas migration in tight reservoirs.
(4) Major types of tight oil reservoirs are tight massive sandstone
reservoir, sand - shale interbed reservoir, and oil-bearing shale
reservoir.
(5) Total tight oil resources in the Ordos Basin are approximately
3.0×109 t, includiing >1 × 109 t of tight oil in shale reservoirs
and approximately 0.9 × 109 t of tight sandstone oil in the 7th
member of Yanchang Formation, and nearly 1.1×109 t of tight
sandstone oil in the 6th member fo Yanchang Formation.
