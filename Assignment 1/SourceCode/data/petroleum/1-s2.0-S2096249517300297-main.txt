Abstract: The tectonic cycle of the marginal sea basins in South China Sea (SCS) includes two cycles,
i.e., the formation and contraction of Palaeo-SCS and Neo-SCS. The northern part of SCS is a rift basin
on a passive continental margin, while the the Nansha Block is a drifting rift basin. The southern part is a
compound compressional basin on an active continental margin; the western part is a shear-extensional
basin on a transform continental margin; the eastern part is an accretionary wedge basin on a subduction
continental margin. The deep-water basins are mainly distributed on the continental slope and the the
Nansha Block. There are three sets of source rocks in the deep-water areas of the northern continental
margin in SCS, i.e., Eocene terrestrial facies, early Oligocene transitional facies and late Oligocene marine
facies. A set of Late Cretaceous-Early Oligocene terrestrial marine facies source rocks are developed in
the drift-rift basin of SCS. Three sets of Oligocene, early Miocene and Mid-Miocene marine-terrestrial
transitional facies source rocks are developed in the deep-water areas of both the southern and western
continental margins of SCS. Four sets of reservoirs developed in the northern deep waters of SCS are
dominated by deep sea fans. Two sets of reservoirs developed in the the Nansha Block are dominated
by delta and biogenic reef. The southern part of SCS is dominated by deep sea fan and biogenic reef.
Reservoirs of large channels and other clastic facies were developed in front of the estuaries, while
biogenic reef bank was formed in the uplift zone. The hydrocarbon accumulation assemblages are mainly
presented as Oligocene-Pliocene in the deep waters on the northern continental margin of SCS, EoceneLower Oligocene in the the Nansha Block, Oligocene-Pliocene and Oligocene-Miocene in the deep waters
on the southern and western continental margin of SCS, respectively. The major hydrocarbon reservoir
types in the deep waters of SCS are related to structural traps, deep water fans and biogenic reefs. The
formation of basin, hydrocarbon and reservoir in the deep waters of SCS are controlled by the tectonic
cycles of the marginal sea basins, revealing a great potential for hydrocarbon exploration.

Key words: tectonic cycles, marginal sea basins; deep water area;
reservoir assemblages; South China Sea

South China Sea (SCS) is one of the most important marginal
sea basins in the Western Pacific, where the geomorphic types
include continental shelf (or island shelf), continental slope (or
island slope), central deep-sea plain and etc.

Large-scale oil and gas exploration of the SCS began in the
1960s, and so far, more than 400 oil and gas fields have been
discovered, mainly distributed in the shallow water areas with
water depth less than 300 m (Zhang et al., 2010). The remaining
oil and gas resources are rich in SCS which is the largest
potential hydrocarbon-bearing province in China with remaining
reserves mainly distributed in the deep-water areas. Through
preliminary exploration, several commercial oil and gas fields
have been discovered in the deep water areas on the southern
continental margin of SCS (mainly in the Brunei-Sabah Basin),
the eastern continental margin (Northwest Palawan Basin)
and the northern continental margin (Pearl River Mouth Basin
and Qiongdongnan Basin). Hydrocarbon-bearing structures
have also been found in the deep water areas on the western
continental margin and the the Nansha Block (Jing, 2006; Zhang
et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2013). The deep water areas of SCS
have great oil and gas potential, it may be comparable to the
large deep-water oil and gas enrichment regions of the eastern
continental margin of Brazil, the western passive continental
margin of Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, the northwest shelf of
Australia, the transform continental margin of East Africa, the
passive continental margin of North Atlantic and Mediterranean
deep waters (Zhang et al., 2011). Understanding on the main
controlling geological factors of basin evolution, hydrocarbon
and reservoir formation in the deep waters of SCS is of great
guiding significance to the oil and gas exploration in the region.

2 Tectonic cycles of marginal sea basins
in SCS
Since Cenozoic, SCS has experienced two cycles of formation
and contraction, i.e., the tectonic cycles of two major marginal sea
basins including the Palaeo-SCS and the Neo-SCS (Fig. 1), which
display different tectonic characteristics in different stages.

2.1 Palaeo-SCS tectonic cycle
Palaeo-SCS experienced three tectonic stages including seafloor
pre-spreading, seafloor spreading and seafloor destruction. During
the seafloor pre-spreading stage of Palaeo-SCS, the South China
Block, Indosinian Block and Borneo Block belonged to the same
large block (South China Sea Platform). Seafloor spreading lasted
from the Cretaceous to the Eocene, during which the Eocene flysch
sediments were developed in the Zengmu Basin and Brunei-Sabah
Basin, indicating the existence of typical deep-water sedimentary
systems on the slope of the passive continental margin. In the
formation stage of the Palaeo-SCS, the Palaeo-tectonic framework
was shown as the central oceanic basin sandwiched between the
southern and northern continental margins (Fig. 1). The northern
continental margin of the Palaeo-SCS presented a pattern of
continental margin-Palaeo-uplift- intracontinental rift from south
to north (Figs 1 and 2). The palaeogeographic patterns of the
palaeo-uplift and the tectonics on both sides were shown as the

40

northern continental faulted depression (e.g., Pearl River Mouth
Basin), central uplift denudation (mid-uplift) and southern marine
facies faulted depression (such as Liyue Basin) (Fig. 1). The Liyue
Basin was always dominated by marine facies sediment from the
Cretaceous to the early Oligocene. Eocene lacustrine facies strata
were found in the Baiyun sag and the Kaiping sag in the Pearl
River Mouth Basin to the north of the palaeo-uplift, revealing that
terrestrial depositional environments existed in the north wing of
the northern continental margin of the Palaeo-SCS. The consuming
of the Palaeo-SCS started from the Oligocene, and the ophiolite
belt formed during that period can be seen on the west side of the
Kalimantan Island. In the Zengmu Basin and the Brunei-Sabah
Basin, some Oligocene molasse sediments were found, proving
the inversion and the consuming of the Palaeo-SCS. Since the
Miocene, the Palaeo-SCS continued to the consuming and subduct
toward the Kalimantan Block. At present, the dissemination of the
Palaeo-SCS is almost completed.

2.2 Tectonic cycles of the Neo-SCS
The Neo-SCS experienced three stages of seaf loor prespreading, seafloor spreading and seafloor destruction (Figs
1 and 2). The seaf loor pre-spreading stage was from the
Cretaceous to the early Oligocene, when the Nansha Block and
South China Block formed a united block and jointly constituted
the northern continental margin of SCS (Figs 1 and 2). Mesozoic
radiolarian fossils indicated that the Nansha Block was cracked
from South China Block, and radiolarians were found in the
Mesozoic strata of the Busuanga Island and northern Palawan
Island in the Calamian Islands of the Palawan Sea, the Nansha

G.Zhang et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,39-52

Block, where radiolarian species emerged at the north latitude of
22°, i.e., the lateral side of the South China continental margin
(Cheng, 1992; Kennett, 1982; Sano et al., 1992; Matsuoka,
1992; Vishnevskaya, 1992). In Well LF35-1-1 of the Chaoshan
Depression, the radiolarian fossil stage was from the Late
Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous, including the Late Jurassic
Pentanellium philip pinense Cheng and Pantanellium corenense
Cheng, consistent with the fossils in the Calamian Islands (Wu
et al., 2007). The Mesozoic rocks in the Nansha Block and South
China Block consist of similar volcanic rocks and sedimentary
rocks. The palaeo-magnetism data indicate that the South China
and the Borneo blocks were a unified block during that period.
The late Yanshanian intrusive rocks were widely distributed in
the northern continental margin of SCS, the Nansha Block and
the Wan’an Basin, mostly presenting NE trending and showing
that there was a unified block during that period.

oceanic crust, the oceanic crust of Neo-SCS was divided into three
parts, including the eastern sub-basin, northwestern sub-basin and
southwestern sub-basin. The body of Neo-SCS was located in the
eastern sub-basin, also known as the central oceanic crust. The
eastern sub-basin presented EW-trending magnetic anomaly belt,
where the south and north ends are the oldest in ages of about 3229 Ma (Barckhausen et al., 2013), whereas the middle section is
the youngest in age of about 16.5 Ma. The fact that the age of the
oceanic crust ages gradually from the center to both south and
north sides with sporadic development indicates that the formation
of oceanic crust began in 32 Ma and lasted for 16 Ma, followed
by SN spreading stagnation of the Neo-SCS (Franke et al., 2014;
Taylor and Hayes., 1983). The significant change happened in this
stage, with the formation of intercontinental rift and oceanic basins,
the cracking and subsidence of mid-uplift (Fig. 1, Paleo-SCS
Platform), and the accretion of the oceanic crust by mantle plume.

During the seafloor spreading stage, i.e., the formation stage of the

The seafloor consuming stage started from 16.5 Ma till now.

Different from the SN expansion of the Neo-SCS, the shrinkage
of the Neo-SCS caused the development of the EW trending
structures (Fig. 2). The formation of the Philippine island arc
belt and the westward obduction led to the eastward subduction
and consuming of the new oceanic basin in SCS (Yao et al.,
2004;Yao et al., 2006). The SCS tectonic cycle controlled
the current tectonic framework of SCS and the formation of
continental margins of different properties.

3 Basin formation in the deep waters
of SCS controlled by tectonic cycle of
marginal sea
In the tectonic cycle evolution of marginal seas, different
tectonic responses occurred in different areas of SCS, thus
forming basins of different properties. Controlled by the tectonic
cycle of marginal seas, the dynamics of SCS are characterized
by “extension in north and compression in south, cracking
and separating of Nansha block, extrusion in east and strikeslip in west”. Specifically, the northern continental margin of
SCS became a passive continental margin, while the southern
continental margin was an active, multiphase superimposed
continental margin. The Nansha Block was a drift block; the
eastern continental margin was a subductive continental margin,
while the western continental margin was transformed to a
passive continental margin. Under such controlling effect, five
types of basin were developed in the South China Sea, i.e., the
passive continental margin rift basin in the northern SCS, the
compressional continental margin basin in the western SCS, the
drift-rift basin in the Nansha Block, the hyperplasia wedge basin
in the eastern SCS and the shear-tensional basin in the western
SCS (Fig. 3).

3.1 Passive continental margin basin in the
northern deep waters of SCS
The current northern continental margin of SCS was significantly
controlled by the tectonic cycles of SCS. Influenced by the PalaeoSCS cycles, multi-episodic non-marine rift occurred in the current
northern SCS, thus forming the Palaeocene-Eocene continental rift
and Early Oligocene land-sea transitional rift. Faulted depressions
occurred in the early expansion of the Neo-SCS, thus forming
the late Oligocene marine rift, faulted depression or depression.
Regional thermal subsidence occurred during the late expansion
of the Neo-SCS, thus forming the early and middle Miocene
marine depression. Regional subsidence also occurred during the
contraction stage of the Neo-SCS with significant tectonic activities
(Fig. 4), thus forming the current shelf-slope system since the Late
Oligocene with water depths increasing from north to south.
Before the expansion of the Neo-SCS and during the early
expansion stage, three episodes of Palaeogene rift occurred on
the northern continental margin of SCS, and the pre-Cenozoic

42

basement fault block was bursted and stretched along the NEnearly EW crustal fracture zone, thus forming faulted rift or
faulted depression. Three hydrocarbon-bearing basin belts were
developed on the northern continental margin of SCS from north
to south. The formation of main faults in Palaeogene showed the
characteristics of early in the north while late in the south.
The northern basins were located in the shallow waters,
among which Palaeogene rifts occurred in the depression
belts of the Beibu Gulf Basin and the northern Pearl River
Mouth Basin, where continental sedimentary strata were
mainly distributed in the faulted depression and to a less extent
developed on the uplift. During the Neogene-Quaternary
depression phase, regional subsidence occurred with a wide
stratigraphic distribution, dominated by marine sedimentation
but with a smaller thickness. The Beibu Gulf Basin is generally
characterized by thick strata during the rift period and thin
strata during depression period, characterized by “much-stuffed
and thin-skinned”. Fault activities were quite strong during the
faulted depression phase, while from the depression period to
the Quaternary, faults and folds were not active except for some
thrust faults and reversal anticlines. The northern Pearl River
Mouth Basin experienced multiple transforms during the rift
period, and mainly developed the residual depressions; from the
Neogene to the late Quaternary, the fault activities were intense
along the NW direction, and the deep lake facies were well
developed in the Eocene.
The main part of central basin belt was located in the deep water
area, including the Qiongdongnan Basin, the Zhu II Depression
of the Pearl River Mouth Basin and the Taixinan Basin. In the
Eocene, initial rifts occurred, which were dominated by continental
sediment with regional mid-deep lacustrine facies and the Neo-SCS
had not been expanded. Regional faulted depression occurred in the
Oligocene and formed large faulted depressions, such as the central
depression of the Qiongdongnan Basin, the Baiyun sag in the Pearl
River Mouth Basin and the south depression in the Taixinan Basin,
which were dominated by marine and land-sea transitional facies
sediments. Rapid regional subsidence occurred after the Miocene
and formed under-compensated continental slope depressions,
which were mainly filled by deep-water sediments. The main part
of this belt was located in the deep water area, where the major
deep depressions included the Baiyun-Liwan sag, the LedongLingshui sag, the Huaguang sag and Songnan-Baodao sag. The
Oligocene was dominated by the deposition of coal-measure strata
and bay facies mudstones with a maximum Cenozoic sedimentary
thickness of 10,000 m (Zhang et al., 2007; Zhang, 2010; Zhang et
al., 2013).
The main body of the southern basin belt was situated in
the ultra-deep waters. Late Palaeogene rifts occurred in the
Zhongsha Trough Basin, the Shuangfeng Basin and the Bijia’nan
Basin, but the strata were not quite developed during the rift

period, showing a depression structure in the Neogene.

3.2 Nansha drift-rift basin
Controlled by the tectonic cycle of the Palaeo-SCS and NeoSCS, the Nansha Block underwent three stages of tectonic
evolution of pre-drift, drift and post-drift, forming a typical
sandwich basin structure (Fig. 5).

The Liyue Basin is the major basin in the Nansha Block and has
experienced three phases of tectonic evolution in the Cenozoic.
11�2�������1�
During the pre-drift stage (Late Cretaceous-Early Oligocene),
the Liyue Basin was located on the south side of the Pearl River
Mouth Basin in the northern SCS near the Chaoshan Depression,

belonging to a passive continental margin basin. During the drift
stage (Late Oligocene- Mid-Miocene), the central ocean basin
of SCS came into being in the Late Oligocene. Consequently,
the Liyue-Northeast Palawan Block was separated from the
northern continental margin and drifted southwards. The Liyue
Basin was located on the northern side of the Palaeo-SCS and
the southern side of Neo-SCS, entering into the stage of regional
subsidence, forming a continental block crack-split basin. During
the post-drift stage (Late Miocene-today), the Liyue-Northeast
Palawan Block collided with Kalimantan and stopped drifting at
the end of the Middle Miocene. With the consuming of tectonic

formation of the Neo-SCS, the blocks collided and formed a
foreland basin. The Liyue Basin was then stopped drifting and
became stagnated at current position. The Nanweixi Basin and
Beikang Basin underwent similar geological evolution.
The sedimentary caprocks of the Northwest Palawan Basin
consisted of the Upper Jurassic -Cretaceous marine facies clastic
rocks, tuffaceous shale, Upper Eocene-Quaternary marine clastic
rocks and carbonate rocks. The basin was divided into the North
Palawan Basin and South Palawan Basin. Before the spreading of
the Neo-SCS, the Palawan Basin was located on the lateral side of
SCS northern margin. Under the tensile stress, the fault blocks in
the pre-Cenozoic basement were broken to form a series of basket

44

or graben-shaped faulted basins. The NS spreading of the NeoSCS made the Palawan Basin gradually drift southwards. Around
the late Middle Miocene, the Palawan micro-block, where Palawan
Basin was located, collided with the Philippines Block and stopped
ever since, forming a foreland basin.

3.3 Compressional basin in the southern SCS
The southern continental margin basement of SCS was formed
during the early shrinking stage of the Palaeo-SCS. The basement
of the eastern Brunei-Sabah Basin (Brunei area) was the folded
and deformed delta plain-deep shale formations of Late OligoceneEarly Miocene. The basement of the western basin (Sabah area)

0

G.Zhang et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,39-52

was the folded Late Eocene-Early Miocene abyssal flysch (Ma et
al., 2012). The basement of the southern Zengmu Bain was the Late
Cretaceous-Eocene shallow metamorphic deep-sea turbidite, which
is an extension of the western Borneo Sibut belt offshore. The
western and southwestern basement of the basin was the MesozoicPalaeocene igneous rock, which might represent the magma
tectonic belt formed during the pre-tension and the early tension
stages of SCS. The eastern and northern basement of the basin are
still unclear.
The sedimentary caprocks of the southern continental margin of
SCS was formed during the shrinking stage of the Palaeo-SCS, and
hugely thick sediments were deposited in the basin. In the PlioceneQuaternary, the Zengmu Basin and SCS ocean basin subsided as a
whole to develop large-scale cladded sediments.

3.4 Shear-tensional basins in the western SCS
The western continental margin of SCS was evidently controlled by
the tectonic cycle of the Neo-SCS. Before the spreading of the NeoSCS (Eocene-Early Oligocene), the western SCS might be part of
the western part of the central uplift, which was under denudation.
During the Neo-SCS splitting stage in the Late OligoceneEarly Miocene, the current western edge of SCS (Wan’an BasinZhongjiannan Basin-Mekong Basin) was parallel to the spreading
axis, thus forming a NE-trending basin under the NW-trending
tension, characterized by NW-trending basin-ridge structures and
recession of the WS-trending extension. During the shrinking
stage of the Neo-SCS (Late Miocene-Quaternary), the extension
stagnated and was replaced by regional subsidence to form the
current continental shelf-slope system.
Taking the Mekong Basin as an example, it shows an N-E trend,
consistent with the southwest sub-basin of the Neo-SCS. The
Mekong Basin was formed mainly during the Oligocene by the
superimposition of the Oligocene-Early Miocene rift and the
Middle-Miocene- Quaternary depression (Sun et al., 2010). The
Mekong Basin was probably the product from the spreading

of the Neo-SCS to the land, which is currently located at the
shallow water area of continental shelf. The Zhongjiannan Basin
was a shear-tensional basin, mainly distributed in the deep
waters. The basin configuration was NS-trending, mainly with
depression characteristics, controlled by differential thermal
subsidence during the shrinking stage of the Neo-SCS. During
the faulted depression stage, the tectonic framework of the basin
was characterized by the NE-trending uplift-depression pattern,
formed by the extension during the spreading of Neo-SCS (Gao
et al., 2007). The northwest end of the Wan’an Basin was located
in the deep water area. The extension during the spreading of
Neo-SCS led to a series of NNE and NE-trending faults and
formation of tilted fault blocks and graben depressions, thus
constituting the lower tectonic framework of the Wan’an Basin.
During the shrinking stage of the Neo-SCS, regional differential
subsidence resulted in the development of the continental shelfslope system (Jing et al., 2004) (Fig. 6). In addition to the NeoSCS cycle, the western continental margin of SCS was also
affected by the sliding of the Indosinian Block.

3.5 Accretionary wedge basin in the western SCS
The eastern continental margin of SCS was formed relatively late
during the consuming stage of the Neo-SCS, jointly controlled by
the westward obduction of the Philippine island arc belt and the
eastward subduction of the Neo-SCS oceanic crust. The basin was
formed on an accretionary wedge (Wan et al., 2002). Bathyal shale
facies sediments were formed in the Oligocene-Early Miocene,
and the subduction occurred from the Late Miocene till present,
dominated by thrust nappes with some regional stretching.

rocks were developed during the Eocene and Oligocene. In
the controlled southern rift basin, a set of source rocks were
developed in the Eocene. In the southern foreland basin, three
sets of source rocks were formed in the Oligocene and Miocene.
In the basins of SCS, the sedimentary facies of main source
rocks were distributed in a belted shape around the central
ocean basin (Fig. 7).

Eocene lacustrine source rocks, the Early Oligocene terrestrialmarine transitional facies coal-measure source rocks and the
Late Oligocene marine source rocks (Huang, 1999; Huang et al.,
2002; Zhang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012).
The Eocene source rocks were formed during the active stage
of the Palaeo-SCS, located in the intracontinental rift on the
northern passive continental margin of the Palaeo-SCS (to the
north of the central uplift, Fig. 1). It is mainly consisted of middeep lacustrine mudstone, which have been encountered in the
Baiyun sag and the Kaiping sag of the deep waters in the Pearl
River Mouth Basin. It might also develop in the Shunde sag and
the Qiongdongnan Basin.

4.1 Eocene and Oligocene source rocks in the
northern margin of SCS
The tectonic cycle of the Palaeo-SCS and the Neo-SCS led to
three phases of Eocene and Oligocene rifting in the northern
continental margin of SCS. Consequently three sets of source
rocks were developed in the northern deep waters, i.e., the

intracontinental lmarine-terrestrial transitional faulted depression
stage before the spreading of the Neo-SCS, equivalent to the early
period of the intercontinental rift, when the Palaeo-geographic
pattern of the Neo-SCS was an EW-trending narrow bay (Fig. 2).
The east end of the gulf might be connected to the PalaeoPacific, as the gulf-marine facies distributed in the west. Some
multiple faulted depressions were formed on the north side
of the gulf (e.g. Pearl River Mouth Basin and Qiongdongnan
Basin), in which deltaic-coal system and marine source rocks
were developed. Oil and gas source correlation analysis shows
that such source rocks are the major source rocks in the deep
waters of the Pearl River Mouth Basin and Qiongdongnan Basin.
At the end of the Oligocene, the Neo-SCS was largely formed,
and the gulf was significantly widened towards the south and
north sides. The northern margin of SCS belonged to a passive
continental margin with a broad marginal sea, where the
depression was located in a marine environment and source
rocks were of neritic facies with well-developed regional gulf
marine mudstones. For example, during the deposition of the
Zhuhai Formation, the Baiyun sag was dominated by a neritic
facies-gulf environment, where source rocks comprise marine
facies mudstones with high abundant sapropel-humic organic
matters. Oil and gas source analysis shows that the Zhuhai
Formation in the Baiyun sag of the Zhu II Depression, in
the Pearl River Mouth Basin contributed to the hydrocarbon
accumulation. During the deposition of the Late Oligocene
Lingshui Formation in the Qiongdongnan Basin, the depression
structure was faulted with neritic-bathyal facies, the organic
matter type and abundance were similar to that of the Baiyun
sag.

4.2 Eocene source rocks in the Nansha rift basin
The Eocene-Early Oligocene faulted depression in the basins
within the Nansha Block were mainly controlled by the
Palaeo-SCS, when the basin group was located in the northern
continental margin of the Palaeo-SCS and developed a set of
marine-terrestrial transitional source rocks. The thickness of
strata was thin during the drift phase and became thick during
the shrinking period. According to the geothermal field and
burial history, only the Eocene-Early Oligocene potential source
rocks could be recognized as the effective source rocks (Xu
et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004). For example, the main source
rocks of the Liyue Basin were developed in the Eocene, and
were distributed mainly in the deltaic as well as shallow marine
facies and controlled by the deltaic deposition. TOC of the wells
near the delta was obviously higher than that of the wells far
away from the delta. The source rocks of the Palawan Basin
were mainly distributed in the Nido Formation (OligoceneMiocene) and the Thian-Rift Formation (beneath the Nido
Formation).

4.3 Oligocene and Miocene source rocks in the
southern foreland basin
The tectonic cycles of the marginal sea basins led to three
phases of the Oligocene and Miocene extrusion in the southern
foreland basin, forming three sets of source rocks. The main
source rocks were delta coal series and neritic mudstones (Liu
and Jing, 1997; Todd et al., 1997). The organic matters in the
source rocks of the Brunei-Sabah Basin comprise the Middle
Miocene-Pliocene terrestrial plants within the mudstone,
carbonaceous mudstone and coal seam, and are dominated by
Type-III kerogen. The source rocks near the basin margin were
partially composed of coal and mudstone, with TOC < 2.0%,
and the kerogen type is mainly Typ III mixed with a minor
Type II2. Three sets of coal measure-marine source rocks of the
Oligocene, Early Miocene and Middle Miocene were developed
in the Zengmu Basin.

4.4 Source rocks in the western deep waters
Controlled by the tectonic cycle of the Neo-SCS, three sets of
source rocks were developed on the western continental margin
of SCS during the pre-spreading, spreading and shrinking
periods (Liu and Wu, 1997; Gao et al., 2007). In this area, three
sets of the Palaeocene-Eocene source rocks were distributed in
the Zhongjiannan Basin, characterized by neritic-swamp and
neritic-bathyal lacustrine mudstones with TOC of 1.75%-0.85%
and TypeII-III kerogen. The Upper Eocene-Oligocene source
rocks were dominated by lacustrine facies and littoral-neritic
facies mudstone, which TOC of mudstone was 0.49%-1.56%
and that of coal and carbonaceous mudstone range from 13.26%
to 21.43% with predominantly Type II-III kerogen. The Lower
Miocene-Middle Miocene source rocks were dominated by
neritic-bathyal mudstone with TOC of 0.69%-0.93% and Type
II-III kerogen.
In the Wan’an Basin, two sets of source rocks were developed
in the Oligocene nearshore limnetic-delta and shallow marine
mudstone and the Lower-Middle Miocene neritic mudstone. The
Oligocene source rocks were the main source rocks with TOC
of 0.50%-2.26% and Type II-III kerogen. The Lower Miocene
source rocks are characterized by low TOC of 0.69% -0.93%
and Type II-III kerogen.
Therefore, the distribution of source rocks in the deep waters
was controlled by the tectonic cycles of marginal sea basins.
The hydrocarbon generation depressions in the deep waters
were mainly distributed on the continental slope, belonging
to thermal depressions or ultra-thermal depressions under
anomalously high geothermal field conditions (Li and Huang,
1990; He et al., 1998; Mi et al., 2009). The source-geothermal
dominated depressions in the deep waters are favourable for gas
generation with auxiliary oil generation.

5 Reservoir formation in the deep waters of
SCS controlled by tectonic cycles of marginal
sea basins

as the primary regional caprocks. The reservoir-caprock
assemblage is characterized by “lower sources-upper reservoirs”
or “self-generated and self-reservoired” which are also present
within the Oligocene stratigraphic interval.

5.1 Hydrocarbon accumulation assemblage

In the Nansha Block, various basins were dominated by the
assemblage of “self-generated, self-reservoired and selftrapped”. Source rocks were formed before the drift of the
Neo-SCS, consisting mainly of the Palaeocene-Eocene delta
source rocks and the Upper Eocene-Lower Oligocene source
rocks. The reservoirs were also formed before the drift, and the
regional cap rocks were formed during the drift and post-drift
periods. Due to the large thickness of the Eocene and the less
development of faults in the late period, the Eocene might be the
major reservoir-cap assemblage.

limnetic facies, the marine-terrestrial transitional source rocks
of the Zhu II Depression and the Qiongdongnan Basin and the
Late Oligocene marine source rocks). During the spreading
period, reservoir rocks were formed during the Oligocene

sandstone and biogenic reefs). During the shrinking phase after

The reservoirs were formed during the Early-Middle Miocene
period, while the regional cap rocks were formed during the
Late Miocene-Pliocene period. The main target layers are the
Miocen-Pliocene reservoirs.

5.2 Reserving body distribution in the deep waters
of SCS
5.2.1 Reservoiring bodies developed in the northern deep
waters of SCS
The northern deep water area of SCS, experienced four-stages of
evolution, formed four sequential sets of reservoirs: (Fig. 9), i.e.,
the river-delta to fan-delta sandstone reservoir developed during
the Eocene intracontinental rift period, the marine-terrestrial
transitional facies developed during the Early Oligocene semiclosed gulf period, the neritic facies-delta-deep water gravity
flow sandstone reservoir developed during the Late Oligocene
open gulf period and the deep-water fan developed during the
Miocene-Pliocene open sea period, respectively (He et al.,
2007; Shi et al., 2010; Wang, 2012). Among them, the Pearl
River deep-water fan system was a deep-water fan composite

sedimentary system formed by a large river, on a wide shelf,
forming a sand-rich delta of the Palaeo-Pearl River. The system
as controlled by the cycles of marginal sea basins to constantly
develop terrace-shaped tectonic subsidence, sourced from
periodic marginal delta and multi-canyon channels.
On both sides of the Zhu II Depression as a large depression
belt in the Central Depression-Pearl River Mouth Basin,
Qiongdongnan Basin, two major biogenic reef belts were
developed. The north belt was mainly developed in the Dongsha
Uplift-Shenhu Uplift of the Pearl River Mouth Basin, while the
south belt was located in the Yongle Uplift on the south side of
the Qiongdongnan Basin.
5.2.2 Reservoiring bodies developed in the Nansha Block
Prior to the drift of the Nansha Block, reservoirs in the area were
dominated by clastic rocks; during the drift and post drift stage,
reservoirs were mainly the biogenic reefs. Taking the Liyue
Basin as an example, the major reservoirs of the PalaeoceneMiddle Eocene included delta, fan delta, underwater fan and
littoral-neritic sandstones. Within the Upper Eocene sequence,

fan delta, underwater fan, littoral and inner-neritic sedimentary
systems were mainly developed, primarily dominated by
sandstone and siltstone. At the edges of the uplift surrounding
the basin, large fan delta and underwater fan were developed.
Within the basin, littoral-neritic sandstone reservoirs were
widely distributed. In the Lower Oligocene sequence, fan
delta, underwater fan, littoral and inner-neritic sedimentary
systems were mainly developed, in which large-scale fan delta,
underwater fan and littoral sandstone were the main reservoirs.
In addition, some Oligocene-Lower Miocene limestone
reservoirs were well developed.
5.2.3 Reservoiring bodies developed in the southern SCS
The southern SCS was formed on the obduction continental
margin of Borneo Block, leading to the formation of nearshore clastic rocks, off-shore biogenic reef reservoirs and deepwater fan reservoirs. For example, eight sedimentary cycles
were deposited in the Brunei-Sabah Basin since the Oligocene.
Cycle I was deposited in the early Oligocene on a passive
continental margin, while Cycle II-VIII were deposited on an
active continental margin. Cycle V-VI contain the mostly welldeveloped reservoirs, which are of the coastal plain, coast and
transitional environment, composed of fine grained to medium
grained sandstone with a permeability as high as 1200 mD and
a porosity as high as 30%. In the Zengmu Basin, the deep water
reservoirs were dominated by deep-water fan and biogenic reef.

5.3 Traps and hydrocarbon reservoirs in the deep
waters of SCS
In the deep water area on the northern continental margin of
SCS, the Late Cretaceous- Quaternary reservoirs experienced
a geological process from intracontinental rift to continental
margin slope of marginal sea., developed the extension
structures earlier and the gravity structures later. Under the
control of normal faulting, faulted anticline, faulted block,
faulted nose and anticlinal structure are the main traps. Deepwater canyons and channels, deep-water fan and biogenic reefs
were also favorable stratigraphic and lithological reservoirs for
hydrocarbon accumulation (Gong et al., 2013). In the proven
hydrocarbon-rich and hydrocarbon-generating depressions
(e.g. the Lingshui sag), the development of central channel,
effective migration channels (diapir/fault) and trap formation
jointly facilitated hydrocarbon accumulations. At present,
a number of hydrocarbon reservoirs have been successively
found in the deep-water areas of the Pearl River Mouth Basin
and the Qiongdongnan Basin, including biogenic-reef anticline
reservoirs of the Dongsha Uplift (e.g. Liuhua 11-1), faulted block
structure-deep-water fan sandstone gas reservoirs formed in
the Early Miocene (e.g. Liwan 3-1), as well as the compaction
anticline-semi-anticline reservoirs with central channel
difference in the Qiongdongnan Basin (e.g. Lingshui 22-1).

50

The Nansha Block was located on the northern continental
margin of SCS during the early period, when extensional
structure was the main tectonic type. During the middle drift
phase, biogenic reefs were developed. During the late period,
the Nansha Block collided with the Borneo Block, leading
to the development of extrusion structure and the continuous
development of biogenic reefs on the Palaeo-uplift. The main
traps of the Nansha Block included faulted anticline, faulted
nose, faulted block and biogenic reefs under an extension
background. The structural traps were mainly developed in the
depressions, while the biogenic reefs were mainly developed in
the Reed Bank. The major reservoir spaces of the hydrocarbon
reef reservoirs include both primary pores and secondary
pores. According to the drilling results, it was confirmed that
biogenic reefs had experienced certain dissolution and strong
dolomitization, forming good reservoir pores. In the meantime,
the evolution of regional biogenic reefs experienced multiple
flooding events, resulting in development of cap rocks locally.
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Nansha Block
evolutionary stages, it can be concluded that the biogenic-reef
hydrocarbon reservoirs had a favorable source-reservoir-caprock
configuration and thus favorable conditions for oil-gas migration
and accumulation. Structural movement was weakened since
the Late Miocene, leading to the preservation of the Nansha
biogenic-reef facies reservoirs.
The southern basins in SCS are fore-arc basins and foreland
basins under an active continental margin setting. The BruneiShabab Basin was a fore-arc basin with a delta sedimentary
system. The sedimentary thickness attained thousands of
meters, consisting mainly of the sand shale strata under deltaic
progradation. Regional compressive stress was superimposed by
the gravity driving during the delta development process, with
trap types being orderly distributed. In the southernmost end,
the tectonic traps related to extrusion were developed within the
thrust nappe structure zone. The central part was a normal fault
zone with gravitational decollement, extending from the outer
continental shelf to the shelf edge. Under the action of tensile
stress, a series of growth faults and rolling anticlines controlled
by the growth faults were formed, dominated by fault traps
and rolling anticline traps. The northernmost end was in an
extrusive tectonic belt with the main sedimentary body in deep
waters. Under the action of extrusion stress, a series of thrust
nappe anticline traps and fault block traps were formed. In the
northern end of the thrust belt, deep-water fan lithologic traps
were developed. In the Balinjian sag of the southern Zengmu
Basin, the structural traps were developed, and biogenic reefs
were also the major trap type.
The western continental margin of SCS was characterized by an
early faulted depression and a slope on the late passive continental
margin. The early development of faulted anticlines, faulted block

G.Zhang et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,39-52

and faulted nose traps were controlled by normal faults. Drape
anticline and biogenic reefs were developed on the uplift.

6 Conclusions
South China Sea underwent two cycles of marginal sea basins,
i.e., a Palaeo-SCS and a Neo-SCS. The tectonic cycles of
the marginal sea basins not only controlled the formation
characteristics of the basin, hydrocarbon reservoirs, but also
controlled the oil-gas exploration potential and reservoir
configuration in deep waters of SCS.
(1) The northern continental margin of SCS, controlled by the
tectonic cycles of the Palaeo-SCS and Neo-SCS, developed
a basin superimposed by the Palaeocene-Eocene continental
rift, the Early Oligocene marine-terrestrial transitional
faulted depression and the marine depression formed since the
Late Oligocene. Three kinds of source rocks were generated
including continental facies, marine-terrestrial transitional
facies and terrigenous marine facies. The heat flow value was
relatively high in deep waters. The deep depressions were
dominated by gas generation, while the depression edges and
shallow depressions were dominated by oil generation. Due to
regional transgression, two types of major clastic reservoiring
bodies were formed with shallow marine facies and deep sea
facies, as well as the regional reservoir-caprock assemblage
characterized by “lower source, middle reservoir and upper
caprock”, indicating a superior exploration prospect.
(2) During the Late Cretaceous-Early Oligocene, the Nansha
Block entered the basin formation stage on the northern
passive continental margin of the Palaeo-SCS, which was
located between the Palaeo-SCS and the Neo-SCS in the
Late Oligocene-Middle Miocene period and collided with the
northern margin of the Borneo Block since the Late Miocene.
Source rocks were formed on the northern margin of the
Palaeo-SCS, while the regional reservoir-caprock was formed
during the drift and collision stages. During the period of NeoSCS, due to the NS extrusion effect, large anticlines and faulted
anticline structures were developed, while during the drift stage,
biogenic reefs were developed due to a lack of river inflow.
During the subsidence stage, the regional marine mudstones
were developed, indicating a superior source-reservoir-caprock
configuration and a huge exploration potential.
(3) The southern continental margin of SCS was a passive
continental margin before and during the Eocene. The major
basin formation stage started from the Oligocene under an
active continental margin setting. Due to regional extrusion, a
sedimentary basin characterized by large area, deep subsidence
and big accommodation space was formed. During this period,
the Borneo Block continued to be uplifted in a tropical rain
forest environment, where rivers, terrestrial plants and animals

were well developed, supplying huge amount of sediments for
the basin. Moreover, with the high geothermal gradient, rich
oil and gas were generated under the joint control of heat and
source. In this area, the reservoirs were better developed in the
deep waters, dominated by deep-water turbidite and biogenic
reefs. In the late period, regional cap rocks were developed to
form a highly efficient source-reservoir-caprock assemblage
characterized by “lower source, middle reservoir and upper
caprock”. Moreover, tectonic traps were also developed by
gravity nappe-extrusion in the deep waters in rows and lines,
and the traps related to biogenic reefs were developed in groups,
indicating superior oil and gas accumulation conditions.
(4) The western continental margin of SCS was formed during
the active period of the Neo-SCS, but located in the extension
line during the spreading of Neo-SCS. During the OligoceneEarly Miocene, the faulted depressions were developed.
Since the Middle Miocene, the narrow passive continental
margin was formed in the depressions. The basin belonged
to a superimposed basin, of which the lower part consisted of
marine-terrestrial transitional facies, and the upper part was
dominated by the passive continental margin sequence. Source
rocks were dominated by deltaic coal measure-marine facies
mudstone. Coupled with high geothermal gradient, the area is
favourable for oil and gas generation. Biogenic reefs and faulted
block structures were the main trap types in this region.
In conclusion, controlled by the tectonic cycles of marginal sea
basins, multiple basins with superior accumulation conditions
were formed in SCS, indicating rich oil and gas resources.
At present, a number of important oil and gas exploration
breakthroughs have been made in the deep waters, but the
overall degree of prospecting is still relatively low, indicating a
considerable exploration potential.
