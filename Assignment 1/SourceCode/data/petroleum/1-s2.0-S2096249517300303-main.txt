Abstract: Adsorbed gas cannot be neglected in the evaluation of coalbed methane and shale gas since
a significant proportion of gas is stored in the form of adsorbed gas. Adsorbed methane of coal and
shale has been widely studied by high-pressure methane adsorption experiment. In sample treatment
of the experiment, the sample is crushed and sieved to a particular particle size range. However, how
particle size influence high-pressure methane adsorption is still unclear. In this study, low-pressure
nitrogen (N2) and high-pressure methane adsorption have been measured on coal samples with
different particle size. According to N2 sorption analysis, pore volume and surface area increase with
particle size reduction. Pore size distribution of small pores (<10nm) changes among varying particle
size. Pore volume proportion of small pores (<10nm) increases and pore volume proportion of big
pores (>10nm) decreases with decreasing particle size. Decreasing particle size by crushing sample
introduces new connectivity for closed pores to the particle surface. The responses of isotherms
of high-pressure methane adsorption are different with different particle size. Methane adsorption
at initial pressure (145psi) increases with decreasing particle size. Adsorption increase rate at high
pressure (435-870psi) decreases with particle size reduction. This can be explained that fine sample
has more pore volume and higher pore volume proportion of small pores (<10nm). Sample with
particle size of 150-250μm has the highest Langmuir volume.

Key words: particle size, high-pressure methane adsorption, coal, shale gas

1 Introduction
Natural gas production in shale gas and coalbed methane is
perspective, especially when taking gas adsorption properties
into consideration. Hydrocarbon gas (mostly methane) can be
stored in pores and fractures, and as adsorbed gas on organic
and inorganic matter. However, heterogeneous pore structure
and complex chemical composition in shale and coal make the
quantification of gas storage challenging (Labani et al., 2013). To
evaluate methane adsorption capacity under reservoir condition,
one reliable and popular research method is high-pressure
methane adsorption experiment (Chalmers and Bustin, 2007a;
Chalmers and Bustin, 2007b; Ross and Bustin, 2009; Zhang et
al., 2012; Gasparik et al., 2014).

Prior to the high-pressure adsorption experiment, the sample
is crushed and sieved to a particular particle size. Surprisingly,
different particle size has been used in high-pressure methane
adsorption related studies (Ross and Bustin, 2009; Zhang et al.,
2012; Gasparik et al., 2014). Table 1 shows particle size used in
high-pressure methane adsorption related studies. A study by
Clarkson and Bustin (1999) has suggested that a particle size of
4mesh (<4.75mm) and 60mesh (<0.250mm) coal sample has a
negligible effect on high-pressure methane adsorption (Clarkson
and Bustin, 1999). Another study on pure clay samples has
shown that methane adsorption capacity of clay minerals
increases with decreasing particle size because of the enlarged
internal surface area (Ji et al., 2012). Furthermore, the effect of
particle size on gas adsorption porosimetry and high-pressure

CO2 adsorption has been investigated as well (Chen et al., 2015;
Lutynski and González González, 2016). The gas adsorption
porosimetry study on shale has shown that micropore volume
generally increases with particle size reduction. The highpressure CO2 adsorption study on coal and shale has shown
that coal samples have different composition among varying
particle size, and shale samples get extended surface area with
decreasing particle size. Although high-pressure methane
adsorption has been widely used, the effect of particle size on
the high-pressure methane adsorption is not clear.
In this study, we measured high-pressure methane adsorption
on the same coal samples but with different particle size. Lowpressure N2 sorption was also engaged to give an insight into
the pore structure of the studied samples. This study attempted
to find out if and how particle size of sample influence highpressure methane adsorption.

at 30℃ by a commercial volumetric apparatus (High pressure
volumetric analyzer) (Fig 1). The experiment setup basically
consists of a vacuum pump, an outgassing furnace with a
temperature controller, a sample cell, a thermostat bath connected with sample cell for controlling the experimental temperature
and a reference cell connected to two pressure transducers (high
pressure transducer and low pressure transducer). All valves are
controlled by a software on the connected computer. Pressure
and temperature are precisely recorded. Prior to the experiment,
helium expansion is used to measure the void volume, which is
defined as the total volume of helium that can penetrate in the
sample cell with the sample inside. After that, the system completely evacuated and methane dosed into the reference cell. As
soon as the pressure equilibrium criteria are met (pressure variation less than 0.01 bar in one minute or waiting for 30 minutes
after dosing the gas into the reference cell), methane is injected
into the sample cell. Methane volume dosed in the system could
be calculated based on pressure, temperature, sample cell volume and the gas compressibility factor. The gas compressibility
factor is determined by Peng-Robinson equation of state. The
amount of adsorbed methane in sample cell is calculated by the
static volumetric method as follows:

Gas adsorption is usually described by isotherms, the amount of
adsorbed gas as a function of pressure at constant temperature.
For methane adsorption on coal and shale, Langmuir equation
is used to fit experiment result in many studies. According to
Langmuir equation, the amount of adsorbed methane (Vads) can
be expressed as follows:

Type B

The experimental data was interpreted by Brunauer-EmmettTeller (BET) method for surface area and density functional
theory (DFT) for pore size distribution. The surface area is calculated by BET method in the P/P0 range of 0.1-0.3 (Brunauer et
al., 1938). Density function theory, comparing to other methods
such as BJH model and DH model, can provide a description
of micropores and smaller mesopores (Do and Do, 2003). Pore
model is considered in density functional theory and determined
by hysteresis loops. Five types of hysteresis loops have been
identified by De Boer (De Boer, 1958) (Fig. 2). Type A hysteresis is correlated with cylindrical pores; type B is attributed to
slit pores; type C and type D are associated with wedge shaped
pores and type E is produced by bottle neck pores.
Besides, the total pore volume is obtained at maximum relative
pressure (P/P0 =1) by the assumption that pores are filled with
liquid adsorbate.

3 Results
3.1 Low-pressure N2 analysis
Fig. 3 shows the comparison of low-pressure N2 adsorption and
desorption isotherms of samples with different particle sizes.
The shapes of isotherm curves reveal type II isotherm (Brunauer
et al., 1940). The nitrogen adsorption at low relative pressure
could be interpreted as the filling of micropores, and isotherms

rise rapidly at P/P0=1 due to the presence of macropores in the
samples. As a general rule of gas adsorption, N2 adsorption of
all samples increases with increasing relative pressure. But the
N2 adsorption rate of increase is greater for the samples with
smaller particle size when compared with samples with larger
particle size.
As shown in Table 3, total pore volume and BET surface area
increase significantly with particle size reduction. The total

pore volume of C45 sample is 0.733cm3 per 100gram, which is
nearly 10 times of total pore volume of C1000 sample (0.07cm3
per 100gram). The BET surface area increases from 0.4757m2/
g to 3.3571m2/g from the coarsest to the finest sample. The BET
surface area is the summary of the internal surface area and the
external surface area. It is assumed that all particles are spherical.
Based on the average radius of the studied samples, external

particle size is shown in Table 3. The internal surface area is
obtained by subtracting external surface area from BET surface

size distribution of samples with different particle size using
incremental pore volume. All studied samples reveal multimodal
pore size distribution and pore volume increases with decreasing
particle size. Although pore size distribution among varying
particle size follows the same trend for pores larger than 10nm,
it is different for pores less than 10nm: the main mode of C45 is
between 2.5nm to 3.7nm; the main mode of C75 is between 3.7nm
to 5.0nm; the main mode of C250 is between 3.0nm to 3.7nm.

small pores (<10nm) increases with particle size reduction.

3.2 High pressure methane analysis
Fig. 5 compares methane adsorption on coal samples with
different particle size. Isotherms curves for samples with
different particle size are different from each other. In general,
methane adsorption capacity increases with decreasing particle
size at 145psi and the adsorption increase rate of the fine
sample decreases rapidly with increasing pressure. C45 has
the highest methane adsorption capacity at 145psi and reaches
its methane adsorption peak at 870psi. C250 has low methane
adsorption capacity at 145psi, but the adsorption increase rate
remains stable with increasing pressure. Therefore, the methane
adsorption capacity of samples at 870psi with different particle
size follows this order: C75>C250>C45 >C1000.

The crushing sample creates new sections in particle and the
sections can connect more pores to the particle surface. The
introduced connectivity of pores enlarges the internal surface
area and pore volume and changes pore size distribution. For
coarse samples, small pores (<10nm) are neglected in that the
pressure equilibrium of N2 sorption takes too much time to
reach or small pores (<10nm) are isolated. As for fine sample,
small pores (<10nm) are connected by new sections and pressure
equilibrium of N2 sorption is easy to reach. Therefore, pore size
distribution of small pores (<10nm) is different with decreasing
particle size.
The hypothetical types of pores are shown in Fig. 6 (Rouquerol
et al., 2014). Decreasing particle size can influence isolated
pores rather than open pores (if pore channels are wide enough
for probe gas). The introduced connectivity of isolated pores
results in an increase in pore volume and surface area and the
difference in pore size distribution. So increase in total pore
volume from C1000 to C45 indicates that isolated pores for the
studied coal sample is at least 10 times of open pores in terms of
pore volume. Meanwhile, pore volume proportion of small pores
(<10nm) increases with particle size reduction, so crushing
sample connects more small pores than big pores (> 10nm).
Therefore, isolated pores have more small pores (<10nm) than
big pores (>10nm) in terms of pore volume.

Particle size can influence pore structure of sample significantly.

2014)

4.2 Effect of particle size on methane sorption
Methane adsorption is closely related to particle size due to the
effect of particle size on surface area, pore volume, and pore
size distribution. The fine sample has enlarged surface area
which provides more sites for adsorption. The sites determine
methane adsorption capacity at low pressure. With increasing
pressure, methane adsorption capacity increases as the general
rule of gas adsorption. But if the pressure continues increasing,
adsorption layers would increase and the sites would be filled
up since the fine sample is mainly composed of small pores. So
fine sample has low methane adsorption increase rate at high

57

J.Zou and R.Rezaee./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,53-58

pressure, which leads to relatively low Langmuir volume. On
the other hand, coarse sample has so small surface area that
methane sorption capacity is low at low pressure. However,
adsorption increase rate would not decrease greatly with
increasing pressure because big pores have more adsorption
sites than small pores. Therefore, Langmuir volume of coarse
sample is similar to fine sample but Langmuir pressure is high.
Based on the experimental results, an appropriate particle size
can be recommended for high-pressure methane adsorption
experiment in this study. If sample powder is too fine, much new
connectivity for small pores is introduced by crushing sample.
Isotherm of the fine sample would be mainly controlled by small
pores. If the sample is too coarse, the time to reach pressure
equilibrium would be very long. Adsorption of small pores is
hard to measure, and isotherm of the coarse sample would be
mainly controlled by big pores. Both small and big pores can
be measured in the 150-250μm sample, and 150-250μm sample
has the highest Langmuir volume. Therefore, 150-250μm can be
used in high-pressure methane adsorption for coal.

5 Conclusions
Coal samples with different particle size have been measured on
low-pressure N2 sorption and high-pressure methane adsorption
to study if and how particle size influence high-pressure
methane adsorption. The following conclusions were made.
Particle size can influence pore structure of coal sample.
The crushing sample can connect closed pores to the particle
surface. Isolated pores have much more pore volume than open
pores in coal sample. So surface area and pore volume increase
significantly with particle size reduction. Furthermore, closed
pores are mainly composed of pores less than 10nm. Pore size
distribution changes and proportion of pore volume increases for
pores less than 10nm with particle size reduction.
Particle size has a great impact on methane adsorption since
pore structure changes with particle size reduction. The fine
sample has introduced much connectivity for closed pores less
than 10nm, which results in that methane adsorption is mainly
controlled by pores less than 10nm. Coarse sample takes too
long to reach pressure equilibrium in adsorption experiment.
Small pores could be neglected and methane adsorption is
mainly controlled by pores larger than 10nm. 150-250μm is the
recommended as the optimized particle size in this study as a
medium sample.
