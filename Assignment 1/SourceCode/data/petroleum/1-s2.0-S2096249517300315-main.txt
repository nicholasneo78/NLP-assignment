associations: Type A is characterized by submarine slide above BSRs and slump lens below BSRs,
whereas Type B shows deformation above BSRs and slump blocks below BSRs. Type A is favourable
for gas exploration because it indicates less decomposition and better sealing of gas hydrate layers.

1 Introduction
Submarine landslides can involve huge amounts of material
and move great distances across the continental slope to the
deep ocean. Similar with landslides on land, they are a kind of
downward and outward movement of slope-forming materials,
whose essential controlling force is gravity (Hampton and
Lee, 1996). Conceptually, submarine landslides and mass

transport deposits (hereinafter referred as MTDs) can be
used interchangeably. The former one focuses on submarine
geomorphology and geomechanics, whereas the latter one
focuses on seismic stratigraphy and fluid flow pattern. Some
well-known large-scale submarine landslide sedimentation in
the world, such as the Storegga one in Norway and some in
Brunei, were referred to different technical names by various
researchers (collapse, landslide and mass movement). In this

paper, they are all referred to submarine landslides. Yu et al
proposed that submarine landslide is one of four deep-water
sedimentary systems (Yu et al., 2014).
Submarine landslides can occur at varying scales. The largest
known deep-water submarine landslide in the world is the Agulhas
landslide in south-eastern Africa, reaching 20,331km3; the modern
Storegga landslide on the shelf margin of Norway, which is 290km
wide, over 800km long and 430m thick, with a width/thickness
ratio up to 675:1; the Lower Carboniferous submarine landslide in
England is 100m long and 15m thick, with a width/thickness ratio
of 7:1 (Shanmugam, 2012).
Research shows that submarine landslides sometimes are closely
related to gas hydrates. Paull et al analyzed the hydrate-bearing
deposits from Leg 164 at Blake Ridge of the Ocean Drilling
Program (ODP), and showed that submarine landslides occur
more frequently on shelf margins that contain gas hydrates (Paull
et al., 1996). Sultan et al consider the Storegga landslide in
Norway to be associated with pore overpressure caused by gas
hydrate decomposition (Sultan et al., 2004).
Previous studies have mostly been done from large-scale 2D
seismic sections between continental shelf-slope break zones and
continental slopes. Limited by resolution, these previous studies
mainly focused on the macroscopic characteristics of the landslide
bodies. However, studies using high-resolution 3D seismic data
indicate that there are many small landslide bodies in large-scale
MTDs due to different structures, slopes, sediments supply and gas
accumulation. In the second gas hydrate drilling area (GMGS2) on
the continental slope of the South China Sea, hydrates are highly
FRQFHQWUDWHGZLWKVWURQJ%65 %RWWRPVLPXODWLQJUH√ÅHFWRU ZKHUH
submarine landslides and hydrates are prerequisites of each other.
Based on the high-resolution 3D seismic data, drilling data, we

investigated the submarine landslides and analyze their relationship
to hydrates in the study area. The results of this study provide
some insight into subsequent submarine landslide research and gas
hydrate exploration in the region.

2 Geological setting
The Dongsha area is situated in the north-eastern part of the
continental slope of South China Sea, and to the east of the
Pearl River Mouth Basin. It is bordered by the Dongsha Uplift to
the west and the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan to the east.
The water depth ranges from 200m to 3500m. The average slope
gradients (the ratio of vertical distance to horizontal distance)
of the study area ranges from 12.8√ó10-3 to 23√ó10-3, being one of
the steepest areas on the continental slope of the South China
Sea (Fig. 1). Multi-beam bathymetry data shows the presence of
IDQOLNHXSOLIWVLQWKHQRUWKHUQSDUWRIWKHDUHDDQGUHODWLYHO\√ÅDW
areas in the southern part.
Tectonically, the area is located on the southeast margin of
Eurasia, at the junction of the Philippine Sea plate and the East
Asia continental margin. It experienced a structural inversion
from an early extension to a late compression. Early extension
occurred in the Eocene with intensive normal faulting, which
was gradually weakened until the early Oligocene. During the
early to late Miocene, an initial compression was developed with
massive thrust faults and associated folds. During the Pliocene
to Holocene, strong compression and uplifting occurred in the
area (Zhu and Wang, 2010; Yu et al., 2013).
In 2013, the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey Brigade of
the China Geological Survey Bureau collected high-purity gas

show the following various occurrences such as layers, massive,
nodular, vein-like, etc. The average gas hydrate bearing rate
in the drilling core ranges from 45%‚Äì55%. The gas hydrate
samples have methane content up to 99%. Eleven boreholes
were drilled in the study area, eight of which encountered
hydrates(GMGS2-01, -04, -05, -07, -08, -09, -11 and -12) (Zhang
et al., 2014)..
The target stratigraphic interval in the study area is divided
into three long-term cycles and six medium-term cycles. The

are mainly distributed in Sequences I and II. The T0-1 interface
is the main termination interface of the shallow detachment

surface, which mostly crosses and overlaps with the BSR.
Landslide bodies mainly develop on T1 surface. The intervals
beneath and above T1 are characterized by high and low seismic
amplitudes, respectively. Sequences I and II were both slightly
compacted, showing relatively great thickness.

distribution
Submarine landslides consist of many gravity flow deposition
types. However, there are many terms for deep-water gravity
flows on the continental slopes, such as rock avalanche, sand
fall, debris flow, slurry flow, slope failure, mass transport,
mass wasting, turbidite, slide, slump, landslide etc. Hence the
classification of submarine landslides is totally different from
the onshore landslides (Table 1).

Based on the shape and structure of submarine landslide bodies
in the study area, combining with their distribution and genesis,
the submarine landslides are divided into seven types (Fig. 2).

Collapse refers to sedimentary bodies sinking irregularly under
gravity, forming Y-type faults, or nearly X-type faults, with
associated folds near them. Within the sedimentary bodies,
sediment layers maintain stratification, but at the conjunction
RIIDXOWVFKDRWLFIDFLHVZLWKZHDNDQGGLVFRQWLQXRXVUH√ÅHFWRUV
RFFXUORFDOO\UH√ÅHFWLQJUXSWXUHDQGGHIRUPDWLRQLQWKHSULPDU\
sediments at stress intersections. The bathymetry above
collapses usually has the assemblages of pop-ups and downdropped blocks, but is generally expressed as elliptical or
banded subsidence. Complex faults and folds were not caused by
compression or extension, but formed by stress relief due to the
subsidence of brittle sediments (Fig. 2b).

3.1.1 Slide
A slide is a coherent mass of sediment that moves along a planar
glide plane and shows no significant internal deformation,
representing translational shear-surface movements. The slide
surfaces with different scales form two combination modes. If
the slide surfaces are similar in scale and parallel with equal dip
angles, they are similar to the ladder-like fault arrays. If they have
relatively different scales, a large-scale slip surface will play as the
principal slip surface and the dip angle decreases gradually from
top to bottom. Small-scale slip surfaces are developed above the
large-scale slip surface possibly with opposite dipping directions,
but their dipping angles are greater than the principal slide surface,
similar to a detachment fault in structural terms. Slide blocks
may be rotated entirely and tilted, forming apparent slide gullies.
The footwall exposed below slide surface due to constitutes the
headscarps. Morphologically, they are expressed as step-like
terrains on multi-beam bathymetry (Fig. 2a).

'HIRUPDWLRQ
Defor mation refers to sedimentar y bodies with plastic
deformation but without obvious faults and folds, representing
by low-amplitude discontinuous rumpled shapes and events
branching and merging irregularly, with obsrued layering
on seismic profiles. It shows low uplifts on the multi-beam
bathymetry, lacking washout gullies, headscarps, and crescentshaped ridges. It is not displaced obviously, but cannot be

considered as a landslide. However, for convenience, it is listed
within the study range as well (Fig. 2c).
3.1.4 Slump wedge

the seismic profile, and ends at the concave surface of faults.
The slump wedge differs from a shallow slide in that a slide is
caused by the instability of sediments under gravity. Cohesive
blocks slide downward along weak stress points. The fault
planes and landslide detachment are usually not the same.
Whereas a slump wedge is formed by structural stress release
caused tectonically. The fault surface is the detachment surface
of landslide bodies (Fig. 2d).
3.1.5 Slump sheet
Slump sheet represents sedimentary bodies with internal
deformation, moving along a relatively flat slip surface. Slump
sheets have clear top and bottom interfaces that are nearly parallel.
They are characterised by a steep detachment surface at the head
and thrust faults at the toe. The internal structure of a slump sheets
is characterised by contorted and disharmonic reflections with
low amplitude and low continuity and thrust blocks caused by

62

compression, which can be occasionally observed. The foot-walls
of reverse faults with a large dip angle on the toe are composed of

3.1.6 Slump block
This is a landslide along a slope, ending at faults (Fig. 2f) or at
relatively competent sediments. It shows a lenticular shape on
WKHVHLVPLFSUR√ÄOHVKRZLQJJRRGFRQWLQXRXVHYHQWVLQWHUQDOO\
without obviously deformations. In terms of the relationship
between these landslides and fractures, it has been postulated
that these were formed when a sandy failures was buried
quickly by later muddy deposits, leading to sealing above and
the formation of early overpressure. Subsequently, with the
burial pressure continuously increasing, the enclosed sandstone
dilated, further forming fractures in the sandstone and adjacent
mudstone (Fig. 2f and Fig. 2g) (Shanmugam, 2006).
3.1.7 Slump lens
It represents a lenticular landslide influenced by liquefaction.
The typical bi-partite structure is composed of high amplitude
reflectors, possibly with lenticular foreset in the lower unit.
Discontinuous and contorted reflectors are developed on the
upper slope of the upper unit. Sheet-like parallel reflectors

L.Wan et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,59-69

converging at the end is present on the lower slope of the upper
units (Fig. 2h). These lenses overlap each other, constituting a
large-scale landslide. Combined with the influence of hydrate
decomposition in the area, it is considered that this complex is

distortion and transformation (Fig. 2i).
According to the statistical data (Table 2), geometrically
slump lens and slump sheet show an obvious longitudinal axis.
However, the collapse range is wide and thin with various
length-width-thickness ratios. The slide, slump lens and slump
block lack obvious longitudinal axis. In terms of fault dip angle,

For some lenticular landslides there are no obvious internal bipartite structures, but they are entirely deformed and bounded by

the collapse may form many faults with similar dip angles.
Faults in slides have dip angles up to 49¬∞, and the tilting angles
for the internal layers reach 19¬∞. Thrust faults at the toe of slump
sheets have much larger dip angles than that of the detachment
surface in the front. The anti-slope faults and down-slope slide
surface in a slump block have high dip angles.
With respect to the development conditions, collapses and
slump sheets are usually formed on gentle slopes with slope
gradients less than 5¬∞. Slides, slump blocks, and slump lenses
are developed on steep slopes with slope gradients greater than
10¬∞. The dip angle of the internal events within the deformations
and slump wedges varies greatly and irregularly.

longitudinal profile with every constant spacing to characterize
their 3D shapes (Fig. 3).
The slump wedge is thick at the middle and head, thin at the

toe and flanks. It generally occurs as a lobate shape, with a
hummocky section at the head. The length of the slide surface
varies slightly. The sediments accumulate below slide surfaces
after sliding on the surface for a distance. Planarly, it is
generally axis-symmetric along the central line. As the central
axis is the main transport path for sediments, the central part at
the toe is usually well developed (Fig. 3a).

these reflectors are basically replaced by parallel reflection
structures (Fig. 3b).
Compared to the other landslide types, slides are characterised
by abrupt variation. Inline-41 shows some obvious offsets with
relatively large fault displacement. In Inline-37, the events are
not obviously faulted, almost without displacement, representing
rapid variation within a short distance (Fig. 3c).
The slump sheet is featured by thinning at the margin and
thickening from centre to toe. In the planar view, the slump
sheet is not entirely axis-symmetric. Taking this slump sheet as

phase (I), faults were formed in the early stage and are of larger
scale, laying a basic structural frame work. In the second phase
(II), faults were much smaller in scales, as a result of large-scale
fault blocks being broken into smaller ones. Gas chimneys were
widely developed between Sequences III and VI, featured by
chaotic seismic facies.

primary tight strata prevented gas invasion. On the other hand,
it is possible that less gas hydrates were decomposed in the area.
So liquefaction only occurred to a small degree. The landslide
bodies were constrained by the anti-slope faults in the middle
part and terminate there. Associated folds (compressive folds)
were formed by structural inversion, which was also the product
of a local compression environment. It formed as sedimentary
bodies which became a hindrance when sliding.
In the southern part of the study area, three phases of slump
sheets can be identified on the profile. The slump sheet
detachment surfaces at the bottom are basically parallel. The
slump sheets are separated by sheeted parallel sediments. The

4 Genetic mechanism of submarine
landslides
Short-term triggers for submarine landslides in the study area
include earthquakes and tsunamis. Medium- to long-term triggers

include sedimentary loading, instability of sand and clay, and gas

is the main triggering mechanism. When gas hydrates were formed,
fresh water and hydrocarbon gas were extracted from pores in
sediments, and transformed into solid hydrates, which played a role

65

L.Wan et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,59-69

in cementing sediments. Therefore, the sediments became more
competent. After gas hydrates were decomposed, the solid hydrates
turned into liquid or free gas, with the methane volumes much
greater than that of the original hydrate volumes. If the reservoir

pressure would be increased accordingly. Overpressure generation
and the volume expansion of sediments with gas would lead to
the decrease of the formation‚Äôs competence and consolidation. If
small faults and gas chimneys were developed in the formations,
they would act as pathways for migration and cause the gas to leak,
transporting toward the shallow part (Wang, 2011) (Table 3).

patterns
The transformation of the gravity flow pattern in deep water
vertically and horizontally was mainly caused by the gradual
variation in the sediments concentration (the volume ratio
of sediments to fluids), which is an important and common
phenomenon. It is one of the important and challenging issues in
deep-water sedimentation research over the years. Turbidity and
debris flows represent two end members of gravity flows and
may result in totally different sediment formation properties.
The properties of the other transitional flows lie in between

rheology with a turbulence state and cohesiveness. The sediment
concentration is usually less than 23%. It is primarily dominated
by suspended load, which principally transports sediments
dominated by mud and silt to fine sands, with normal graded
bedding (Hampton, 1972; Postma et al., 1988; Mutti et al., 1999;
Shanmugam, 2002; Shanmugam, 2006).

The transformation of gravity flow on the plane has been
accepted by most scholars. Flume tank experiments have

scale examples can also be observed at outcrops. There have
been many breakthroughs in research on vertical gravity flow
pattern transformation. Near the base there exists a denser and
highly concentrated layer called the laminar layer or inertial√ÅRZOD\HU,WGHYHORSHGDZHGJHWKLFNHQLQJFRQWLQXRXVO\XS√ÅRZ

above is faster. From the boundary between turbulent current
and debris flow to the top the density will degrease. On the
top the turbulent clouds are well developed. The curves show
elustriation of mud (Fig. 6).This composite fluid with coarser

4.2 Genetic mechanisms for submarine landslides
There are two aspects for the genetic mechanisms of mass
failures. One is the increase in the net component of the
downward force which is parallel to the continental slope, while
the other is a decrease in the adhesive force between sediments.
Firstly, the complexity lies in that the sediments and underlying
formations were bonded together prior to the detachment surface
was formed. Secondly, the shape and components of sediments
varied constantly during the sliding. There was an exchange of
material between sediments and water around the landslides,
which maintains a dynamic balance in any one moment (Fig. 7).
There are many possible reasons for the decrease in adhesive
force. With respect to the external factors, long-term bottom
flow modification, and mutual physiochemical action between

water and sediments lead sediments to become looser and
finer. Tectonic stress could also have formed many small
faults as well, which may lead sediments to split into many
small fault blocks. The internal factors reside in the high pore
pressure formed by the gas invasion that could have decreased
the formation strength. The presence of gas and water could
have promoted sediment liquefaction under the function of
earthquakes and tsunamis. The decrease in the bond between
sediments and the underlying formations can be caused by
many factors. For instance, joint surfaces parallel to the bedding
plane were developed or there were strata like shale with good
layering with weak interstratified force or fine-grained layers

form crash pads as well.
With respect to the external stress, the relative difference of the
weight component toward the down slope and friction jointly
decide the stability of sediments. Gravity not only includes the
gravity produced from the weight of sediments, but also the
water pressure and structural stress. The influencing factors
include, first, the fact that the repose slope (maximum slope
gradients under which sediments are stable) differ from various
sediment sizes. The larger the grain size is, the steeper the
slopes will be. In addition, it is also related to the roundness
of sedimentary grains. If the sedimentary grains are angular
or sub-angular, the maximum slope gradient can reach 45¬∞

(Stephen, 2013). Secondly, the greater the slope gradients,
the larger the gravity components will be along the slopes,
which can cause instability. The gradients of the continental
slopes reached 18¬∞ in the south, and approximately 3-5¬∞ in the
northern part of the study area. Therefore, this is the reason
why landslides were better developed in the north than in the
south. Thirdly, the static frictional force is often greater than
the kinetic frictional force. Hence the stress produced from
sudden tectonic events (e.g. earthquakes, tsunami, etc.) can
increase the gravity component along the slope abruptly, causing
slides. The energy accumulated by tectonic activities will be
released periodically. Consequently, slides are characterised by
coincidence and unpredictability. Fourthly, increasing sediments
load will also increase the gravity component along the slopes,
so the slide of sediments from the upper continental slope and
the vertical aggradations of the hemi- pelagic could trigger
landslides. Variation in water depth is another controlling factor.

5 Relationship between submarine landslides
and BSRs
Hydrates-bearing intervals are subject to subsidence by sediment
loading and tectonic subsidence. As a result, the temperature and
pressure would be no longer suitable for hydrates to maintain
an equilibrium. Therefore, gas hydrates would be gradually
decomposed (Fig. 8a). In addition, free gas would move upward

successively along the gas chimneys and faults. Therefore, the
area below the interval containing gas hydrates is commonly
associated with high free gas concentration. After the hydrate
layers are saturated with gas, they have a limited capability
for absorbing and transforming free gas to gas hydrates. Strata
with abundant hydrates can become seals for the gas immediate
below as well (Fig. 8b and Fig. 8c). Differential capacities of
sealing may thus lead to obviously different distributions of
gas, and different landslide body associations. During the gas
hydrate exploration, hydrate development can also be estimated
by identifying the landslide associations.

BSRs irregularly) and slump blocks developed below BSRs. The

2014).

There are two kinds of relationships between submarine
landslides and BSRs in the study area. Type A is characterised
by slides above BSRs (the detachment surface of the slide
commonly ends at the BSRs) and slump lenses below BSRs,
indicating that there are more decomposed hydrates and a large
quantity of free gas in the lower part with strong liquefaction
of sediments. Whereas there is a well-sealed hydrates layer in
the upper part, there would be a weak area forming near the
hydrate bottom interface. Therefore slides would occur easily.
The upper part would not be affected substantially by free gas
in this case (Fig. 8d). In Well GMGS2-08, the hydrate-bearing
interval is more than 20m thick, containing high-purity massive
gas hydrates with saturation up to 55% (Zhang et al., 2014).

(3) For the geometry, slump sheet and wedge have obvious long
axes while slide slump lens and block have similar length and
width. For formation environment, the collapse and slump sheet
develop when the slope gradient is below 5¬∞, while the slide, slump
block and lens occur when the slope gradient higher than 10¬∞.
(4) In the study area, the trigger mechanism for these landslide
bodies include gas hydrate decomposition, sediments overload,
instability of sand and clay, and tectonic events. The dominant
factor is free gas from gas hydrate decomposition.

BSRs are documented. Type A is characterised by slide above

by collapse or deformation above BSRs while slump block
below BSRs. The interval above BSRs is influenced more by
hydrate decomposition.
