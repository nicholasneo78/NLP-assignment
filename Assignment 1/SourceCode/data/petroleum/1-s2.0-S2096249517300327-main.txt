Abstract: Shale oil and gas plays in continental rift basins are complicated and have not been
reported elsewhere. In the Luojia area of the Jiyang Depression, an evaluation workflow for shale
oil and gas in this continental rift basin is proposed. Based on analysis of oil- and gas-related
geological conditions, a favorable area of shale oil and gas can be identified, and a high-frequency
sequence stratigraphic framework of the target area can be established, therefore, the spatiotemporal
distribution of shale has been elucidated in the Luojia area. According to the rock texture, structure,
composition and color, petrographic classification criteria for shale are determined, and well log data
are used to demarcate, track and predict high-quality lithofacies. Based on geochemical analyses
and physical simulations of hydrocarbon generation, abundance, types and maturity of organic
matter are analyzed, furthermore, geochemical parameters criteria of hydrocarbon generation and
the characteristics of oil and gas occurrence in shales can be determined. Storage space types,
assemblages and evolution characteristics of shale reservoirs are studied through core observation,
thin-section analysis, electron microscopy examination and fluorescence spectrometry. Combined
with analysis of reservoir physical properties, the reservoir performance is evaluated. A saturation
model is established based on core analysis, well-log interpretation and well-test production data. The
model is further used for evaluation of the movable hydrocarbon contents and integrated assessment
of the oil potential. Finally, the shale oil and gas production capacity and exploration prospects in
the Luojia area are forecasted based on the analyses of factors controlling production capacity and
the rock fracability. Through an integrated analysis of multi-factors (including the lithofacies, source
rocks, reservoir properties, oil saturation, and production capacity), the shales in the Luojia area
can be divided into three categories, i. e., Class I (high porosity - high resistivity), Class II (medium
porosity - medium resistivity), and Class III (low porosity - medium resistivity).

as Australia, Sweden, Poland, and China. According to the
preliminary assessment results of the U.S. Energy Information
Administration released in June 2013, the global technically
recoverable shale gas resource is 220.73×1012 m3. According to
the forecasts by different scholars or organizations, shale gas
resources in China are (30–166)×1012 m3 with the technically
recoverable resources of (7–45)×1012 m3 (Zou et al., 2011). Shale
oil resources in China are estimated approximately 47.6×109 t
with the recoverable resources of approximately 10×109 t, and
shale oil and gas resources in China are mainly distributed
in three marine depressions/basins (southern Yangtze region,
North China, and Tarim Basin) and five continental basins
(Junggar, Turpan-Hami, Ordos, Songliao, and Bohai Bay) (Li
et al., 2009; Nie et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011),

resources in the study area.

2 Shale gas exploration prospects
The Jiyang Depression is located in southeastern Bohai Bay
Basin, which connects to the Chengning Uplift via large-scale
bedrock faults to the northwest and is adjacent to the Tanlu Fault
to the east and Luxi Uplift to the south. This depression covers
an area of 25.51×103 km2. Being a Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift
- depression superimposed basin developed on the basement of
the North China Platform, the Jiyang Depression is separated
by a few highs such as Qingcheng, Binxian, Chenjiazhuang, and
Yihezhuang into four sags, i.e., Dongying, Huimin, Zhanhua,
and Chezhen (Fig. 1). In the Early Eocene, the Jiyang rift
lacustrine basin entered the peak rift - subsidence period and
experienced relatively stable tectonic movement, the lacustrine
basin continued to subside in a warm and humid climate, and
terrigenous detritus entered into the lake and delivered a large
amount of nutrients, therefore, massive growth of aquatic
organisms occurred in the lake, leading hydrocarbon source
rocks developed in the upper sub-member of the 4th member,
lower and middle sub-members of the 3rd member, and the 1st
member of the Shahejie Formation (Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang
et al., 2009). Drilling data show that in the Jiyang Depression,
shale formations are mainly distributed in the Paleogene strata
of the upper sub-member of 4th member, lower sub-member
of 3rd member, and the 1st member of the Shahejie Formation.
These shale formations are characterized by large thickness,
abundant organic matter dominated by the sapropelic - mixed
type, and wide occurrence of organic maturity (Wang and Qian,

The Jiyang Depression, which has undergone a 50-year period
of exploration, is an oil and gas-rich depression in the Bohai Bay
Basin. The well density of the Jiyang Depression is up to 0.2 per
km2 and the overall water-cut reaches 91.0%. Since the depression
has entered into a stratigraphic and lithological reservoir play
exploration stage as a whole, there are increasing challenges in
the conventional oil and gas exploration. Therefore, to ensure the
sustainable development of the Shengli Oilfield, the exploration
of unconventional shale oil and gas thus becomes quite urgent. In
this study, a detailed analysis is performed on shale oil and gas
resources in the Luojia area. We hope to explore the technologies,
workflow and methodology for shale oil and gas exploration
in continental rift basins and to provide supporting data and
technological reserves for evaluation of unconventional oil and gas

1992; Zhang et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2006). The content of
total organic carbon (TOC) is >2.0%, and the organic maturity
(Ro) is >0.5%. The favorable distribution area of source rocks
with the thickness >50 m is 5524 km 2. These conditions form
the material basis for large-scale shale oil and gas generation in
Jiyang Depression.
During the early stage of conventional oil and gas exploration,
abnormal mud (logging) gas with oil and gas shows were
frequently observed in shales of the Paleogene Shahejie
Formation. In 1973, Well He 54 was drilled in the central uplift
in the Dongying Sag. Drill stem test of the shale formation at
2928–2964.4 m of the lower 3rd member of Shahejie Formation
with 5-mm discharge nozzle obtained a gas production of 2740
m 3/d. Thus, Well He 54 became the first commercial oil and
gas flow well of shale in the Jiyang Depression. Thereafter,

high-yield oil and gas flow was successively obtained in wells
Luo 42 in the Zhanhua Sag, Xinguo 3 in the Chezhen Sag, and
Lishen 101 in the Dongying Sag. By the end of 2011, oil and
gas shows had been observed in shales of over 300 wells in the
Jiyang Depression, of which 30 wells yielded industrial oil and
gas flow (Table 1). The oil and gas flow wells feature multi-layer
distribution in a number of sags, indicating great potential for
shale exploration in the Jiyang Depression.

3 Shale oil and gas evaluation
The lower sub-member of 3rd member of Shahejie Formation
in the Luojia area is preferentially chosen for shale oil and gas
evaluation because of its large thickness of shale formation
(100–300 m), large number of wells with oil and gas shows (all
of the 24 wells in the Luojia area have oil and gas shows in the
shale formations, with three wells producing industrial oil flow

In the conventional oil and gas exploration, shale formations
are generally considered to be homogeneous layers. However,
the shale oil and gas exploration requires investigating
differences and variations in shale layers regarding reservoir
property, organic enrichment, oil and gas saturation, and oil
and gas accumulation patterns, in order to identify favorable
development formations of shale oil and gas. Therefore, the
existing conventional oil and gas division scheme can no longer
meet needs of shale oil and gas exploration, and in-depth study
is needed for detailed research.
Because shale deposition differs from sand and conglomerate
depositional cycles, use of conventional logging data for fine
layer comparison of shale formations has low accuracy. Based
on previously established three-tier stratigraphic sequence
framework, this study carries out high-frequency sequence
correlation and division of the lower sub-member of 3rd member
of Shahejie Formation in the Luojia area using ratios of between
thorium and potassium (Th/K) to reflect changes in relative lake

The terrestrial lacustrine basin features complex lithofacies, with
industrial oil and gas flow obtained from over 10 types of shale
formations in terms of lithology. The basin is characterized by
rapid lithofacies changes and strong heterogeneity. Different
lithofacies show substantial variations in the reservoir properties
and hydrocarbon generation capability. Therefore, detailed
petrographic studies are needed for identifying types and
distribution of favorable lithofacies of shale oil and gas, further
providing supporting data for sweet-spot forecasting in this area.
Extensive core and thin-section observations indicate that shale
formations in Well Luo 69 contain common horizontal bedding, as
reflected by changes in mineral compositions, color, and bedding

Comparison of the high-frequency sequence sections of Well
Luo 58 to Well Luo 67 shows that the lower 3rd member of
Shahejie Formation can be further divided into four 4th-order
sequences, designated Sequence 10, 11, 12, and 13 from top to
bottom. Core observation and logging data analysis indicate that
formations with oil and gas shows are mainly concentrated in
the lower part of Sequence 12 and upper part of Sequence 13 (Fig.
2). Considering that shale formations that yield shale oil and
gas flow in the early exploration stage are concentrated in these
sequences, the lower Sequence 12 and upper Sequence 13 are
chosen as the target formations for research on shale oil and gas
in the area.

depth (2500–3500 m), and sufficient data. For example, in the
shale oil and gas well, Well Luo 69, a core of 221.36 m long was
obtained by systematic coring of the shale units, and about 8750
samples were analyzed. In addition to the conventional logging,
another six logging tools were run, including three-dimensional
resistivity, imaging, nuclear magnetism, gamma spectroscopy,
multi-pole sonic logging, and stratigraphic element. The shale
oil and gas evaluation is carried out with respects to pay
interval selection, lithofacies, source rock, reservoir, oil and gas
saturation, and production capacity.

thickness. The results of thin-section analysis show that major
rock components are argillaceous rocks with a scale structure and
calcites with primary cryptocrystalline structures and secondary
microscopic crystal - cryptocrystalline and cryptocrystalline
- microscopic crystal structures. From core observation and
microscopic analysis, the lithofacies subdivision of shales in the
lower sub-member of 3rd member in the Luojia area is carried out
based on combination of rock texture, structure characteristics, and
compositions. The major lithofacies are laminated argillaceous
limestone lithofacies, bedded argillaceous limestone lithofacies,
(a)

and bedded calcareous mudstone lithofacies (Fig. 3) with a few
transitional lithofacies.
Because different lithofacies have various compositions,
structures, and oil and gas potential, their corresponding
logging responses are different as well. This leads to substantial
difficulties in establishing conventional logging facies model.
In this study, a conventional logging facies model is firstly
established by logging via core scale image and calibration of
conventional log by image log. Finally, three curves of density

(DEN), acoustic time-difference (AC), and resistivity (RT) are
preferentially chosen for lithofacies subdivision (Fig. 4). Of
the three major lithofacies, laminated argillaceous limestone
lithofacies has the largest values of AC and RT, indicating
high extents of reservoir space development as well as oil and
gas accumulation. Additionally, this lithofacies has relatively
high density, suggesting high content of brittle carbonate
minerals that can easily be fractured. Therefore, the laminated
argillaceous limestone lithofacies is a possible sweet-spot
lithofacies.
Using the conventional logging facies model and according
to modern lacustrine depositional characteristics, the crosssectional and planar facies analyses are conducted to identify
vertical distribution patterns of different lithofacies. Results
show that the laminated argillaceous limestone lithofacies is
mainly distributed in the lower part of Sequence 12 and the
upper part of Sequence 13; the laminated - bedded argillaceous
limestone lithofacies is mainly distributed in the middle part
of Sequence 12 and 13; the bedded argillaceous limestone

74

lithofacies and the bedded calcareous mudstone lithofacies are
mainly distributed in Sequence 10 and 11 as well as the lower
part of Sequence 13.

3.3 Source rock characteristics
The source rock evaluation parameters for the commercial
exploitation area of shale oil and gas in North America
include TOC, Ro, and dark shale thickness (Martineau, 2007).
Accordingly, based on geochemical analyses and hydrocarbon
generation simulations, the abundance, types, and maturity of
organic matter in the Luojia area are demarcated, and criteria of
geochemical parameters for shale oil and gas exploration in the
Jiyang Depression are established, to further identify favorable
source rocks in the study area.
3.3.1 Abundance of organic matter
The adsorbed hydrocarbons (S1) and relative content of TOC are
two parameters commonly used for assessing liquid hydrocarbon
content. With ratios S1/TOC of 100 mg/g as critical point, those

with ratios <100 mg/g are adsorbed liquid hydrocarbons and those
with ratios >100 mg/g are free-state hydrocarbons (Dong et al.,
2009). Examination of relationship between S1/TOC and TOC
content of source rocks in the lower sub-member of 3rd member
in Jiyang Depression shows that when S1/TOC is >100 mg/g, the
TOC content is generally >2% (Fig. 5a). The TOC content of most
samples from hydrocarbon source rocks in the lower sub-member
of 3rd member in Well Luo 69 meets above standard. Of these,

3.3.2 Major types of organic matter

marine strata dominated by the Type-I and/or Type-II1 organic
matter (Jarvie et al., 2004; Ross and Bustin, 2009). In the lower

3.3.3 Extent of organic matter evolution
Previously, Huang (1996) studied hydrocarbon generation and
its relations with source of parent materials as well as properties
and distribution of oil and gas, further proposing thresholds Ro of
substantial oil generation and gas generation in hydrocarbon source
rocks in Jiyang Depression to be 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The
lower sub-member of 3rd member in the Luojia area (Ro of 0.70%–
0.93%, burial depth of 2500–3500 m) is experiencing a massive
oil generation stage. This is different from the situation of shale oil

and gas exploration areas in North America that mainly produce
gas or condensate oil, and further study is needed to investigate
the underlying mechanisms for such a difference. Because of
large variations in molecular diameter, density, and viscosity of oil
and gas, there may exist different occurrence and accumulation
mechanisms. Taking into account that the mature oil flows easily,
the threshold Ro for shale oil and gas in Jiyang Depression that
should be >0.5% is proposed
3.3.4 Effective shale thickness
In the North American shale gas evaluation, the thickness of
shale formations is required to be >30 m. This threshold value

3.4 Reservoir characteristics
In view of the low porosity and low permeability of shale
reservoirs, electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence microscopy,
and X-ray three-dimensional diffraction imaging technologies are
used for investigating space types, assemblages, and development
characteristics of shale reservoirs. Combined with analysis of
physical properties, performance of reservoirs is evaluated and the
high-quality reservoirs are preferentially selected.

Core observations demonstrate presence of a large number
of diagenetic bedding fractures, abnormally-high-pressure
fractures, oblique structural fractures (filled or unfilled),
differential compaction fractures, and dissolution fractures
(Figs. 7a–c). The development of these fractures imposes great
influences on shale oil and gas accumulation. The development
of fractures is conducive to accumulation and permeation of
free-state oil and gas, which can improve natural production
capacity. Electron microscopy images show that there are
a number of intergranular pores (1–15 μm in diameter) and
interlayer micro-fractures (1–2 μm in width) in clay minerals
and carbonate minerals (Figs. 7d–e). Fluorescence observations

should be ≥15 m for source rocks with highly abundant organic
matter (Bowker, 2003; Li et al., 2007), as specific to marine
strata with relatively stable distribution. In order to determine
effective thickness of shale oil and gas-generating layers in
Jiyang Depression, statistics is performed on related parameters
of shale oil and gas-generating segments in a total of 35 wells.
Results show that the thickness of shale formations with oil and
gas show mostly varies in the range of 50–150 m, while that
of mudstones in few wells is limited in the range of 45–50 m
(Fig. 6). Accordingly, the minimum threshold of the effective
thickness of shale formations in Jiyang Depression can be 50
m. In the lower sub-member of 3rd member in the Luojia area,
the thickness of the lower Sequence 12 and the upper Sequence
13 with concentrated high-quality shales (54 m) is greater than
the threshold value (50 m), indicating that these shales meet
requirement of the minimum thickness.

show that some of fractures and calcites have green fluorescence
while intergranular asphaltenes do not emit fluorescence light.
Additionally, organic micro-pores are detected by using argon
ion polishing technology (Fig. 7f). Overall, shale formations
in the study area have developed 2 types of reservoir spaces,
i.e., fracture and micro-pore. The former type is dominated
by bedding micro-fractures, followed by oblique structural
fractures; the latter type is dominated by calcites (dolomites).
These reservoirs spaces are primarily developed in laminated
argillaceous limestones associated with laminae development
and high levels of carbonate rocks, possibly due to the layered
distribution of organic matter, high capability of hydrocarbon
generation (pressurization), and high content of brittleness
carbonate minerals in these rocks.
3.4.2 Physical properties
Statistics of porosity data of 364 samples and permeability data of
496 samples from Well Luo 69 are shown in Table 2. The porosity
of shale reservoirs in the lower sub-member of the 3rd member
ranges from 1.3% to 13.6%, mainly in the range of 2–8% (average
5%); the corresponding permeability varies greatly (maximum
493 mD, possibly related to development of fractures), generally
in the range of 1–10 mD followed by 0.1–1 mD (average 7.72 mD).

Of the different types of lithofacies, the laminated argillaceous
limestone lithofacies that mainly distributed in the lower Sequence
12 and upper Sequence 13 has the best physical properties (average
porosity 5.9%, average permeability 17.1 mD), thus are considered
to be the most favorable reservoirs. The laminated - bedded
argillaceous limestone lithofacies is the medium-quality reservoirs
(average porosity 5.1%, average permeability 3.4 mD) and is
mainly distributed in the middle Sequence 12 and 13. The bedded
calcareous mudstone lithofacies and the argillaceous limestone
lithofacies have poor physical properties (average porosity 4.3%,
average permeability 2.4 mD) and are mainly distributed in the
Sequence 10 and 11 and the lower Sequence 13.

3.5 Oil and gas potential
Based on the core data, a saturation model is established by
well-log interpretation and then verified with the well-test and
production-test data. The model is further used for assessing
content of movable hydrocarbons and comprehensive evaluation
of oil and gas potential.
In the shale formations, changes in porosity are negatively
correlated to those in water saturation. The higher porosity,
the higher degree of oil and gas fullness, and the lower water

saturation. Then, a calculation model of water saturation
is obtained through multivariate regression of laboratory
measurements of water saturation and clay content, porosity, and
resistivity of shale rocks:

lg S w = 0.0964φ + 0.0039Vsh − 0.1478lg(RT ) + 1.9616
2

R = 0.6883

where Sw is water saturation, %; φ is the porosity, %; Vsh is the
clay content, %; and RT is the resistivity, Ω·m.
The regression water saturation fits well with the measured
saturation (R2=0.6683)(Fig. 8), indicating good practicability of
the interpretation model in the Luojia area.
As shown by product of the measured porosity and oil saturation

(So) in Well Luo 69, free-state oil and gas are present in the whole
shale formation. The high product of porosity and oil saturation
correspond to laminated argillaceous limestone lithofacies in the
lower Sequence 12 (3023–3055 m) and the upper Sequence 13
(3055–3062 m) (Fig. 9), suggesting good reservoir property and
shale oil and gas accumulation in this formation.

3.6 Production capacity
Based on analysis of pre-drilled well production in combination
with rock compressibility, this study analyzes influencing factors
of production capacity in order to provide supporting data for
favorable target forecasting. The shale formations primarily
produce oil (density of 0.89–0.94 t/m 3, viscosity of 16.1–208
mPa·s) accompanied with shale gases (mainly methane, ethane

77

Y.Wang et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,70-80

the evolution of source rocks determines state of oil and gas
occurrence. Source rocks in the sub-member of 3rd member of
Shahejie Formation of Well Luo 69 have burial depths of 2500–
3500 m, Type-I organic matter, and Ro of 0.7%–0.93%, thus are
in a massive liquid hydrocarbon generation stage and mainly
producing oil. The lithofacies development determines extent
of shale oil and gas accumulation. Laminated argillaceous
limestone consists of calcite interbedded with organic mudstone,
and thus has high organic matter content and well-developed
reservoir spaces, both conducive to oil and gas accumulation.
Abnormally high pressure and fracture activities influence
shale oil and gas production capacity as well. It has been found
that wells close to the fault zones have developed secondary
fractures and show relatively high production capacity.

Through integrated analysis of factors, such as lithofacies,
source rocks, reservoir properties, shales in the lower submember of the 3rd member of Shahejie Formation in the Luojia
area are comprehensively evaluated and divided into 3 classes
(Table 3).

and carbon dioxide, relative density of 0.87–0.97), showing
characteristics of initially high production, low water content,
and rapid decline of the production. The evolution extent of
source rocks, lithofacies, abnormal pressure, and development
degree of fractures are the major factors that influence shale
oil and gas production capacity in the study area. Of these,

78

It is worthy noting that different from conventional resource
exploration, shale oil and gas resources are primarily exploited
using the horizontal well - long well segment fracturing
technology, in which fracturing capacity is mainly controlled
by type, structure and content of brittle formation minerals.
In the Luojia area, brittle minerals in shale formations mainly
consist of carbonate minerals, unlike those dominated by quartz
in shale oil- and gas-generating formations in North America
(Ross and Bustin, 2008). Therefore, influence of high carbonate
content on shale reservoir space and appropriate measures for
well completion need to be further investigated. Content of
carbonate minerals in shale formations has a positive correlation
with rock compressibility.

High-porosity and high-resistivity shales have following
characteristics: (1) the porosity is 4 –13.6% and the true
formation resistivity (RT) is 64–186 Ω·m; (2) the spontaneous
potential (SP) shows significant amplitude of anomalies; (3) the
acoustic (AC) and neutron log (CNL) are large while the density
(DEN) is low, indicating good physical properties of shale
reservoirs; (4) the resistivity, as well as the chloroform bitumen
“A” content and the oil and gas saturation are high, indicating
good quality of the oil; (5) the longitudinal and transversal
wave velocities show an increase, reflecting well development
of texture; and (6) the abnormal formation pressure is high,
favoring oil and gas accumulation and production. The highporosity and high-resistivity of shales, designated as Class
I, are considered to be most favorable reservoir, and mainly

sub-member of the 3rd member..
3.7.2 Medium-porosity and medium-resistivity shales (Class II)
Medium-porosity and medium-resistivity shales, designated as
Class II, have the following characteristics: (1) the porosity is
4.2%–8.7% and the RT is 34–108 Ω·m; (2) the AC, CNL, and DEN
values are medium while the SP curve has no obvious amplitude,
suggesting relatively poor physical properties as compared to those
of Class I shale reservoirs; (3) oil saturation is slightly lower than
that of Class I shale reservoirs; and (4) the chloroform bitumen
“A” content is relatively high. The Class II shale reservoirs are
mainly distributed in the laminated-bedded argillaceous limestone
lithofacies in the middle Sequence 13 and 12 of the lower submember of the 3rd member in the study area.
3.7.3 Low-porosity and medium-resistivity shales (Class III)
Low-porosity and medium-resistivity shales have following
characteristics: (1) the porosity is 2.2%–10% and the RT is
13–54 Ω·m; (2) the CNL and GR values are high while the DEN
values are low, indicating high content of argillaceous materials;
(3) the SP curve has amplitude difference, indicating poor
physical properties of shale reservoirs; and (4) the chloroform
bitumen “A” content is low; and the oil and gas saturation is low.
The Class III shale reservoirs are mainly distributed in bedded
argillaceous limestone lithofacies and calcareous mudstone
lithofacies in the upper Sequence 10, 11, and 12 and the lower
Sequence 13.

4 Conclusions
An integrated evaluation is conducted on the lithofacies,

2.4

2.2-10

13-54

source rocks, reservoir properties, oil and gas potentials, and
production capacity of shale reservoirs in the Luojia area. The
shale reservoirs in the area are classified into the following three
categories: high-porosity-high-resistivity (Class I), mediumporosity-medium-resistivity (Class II), and low-porositymedium-resistivity (Class III). The Class-I shales are mainly
developed in the laminated argillaceous limestone lithofacies
that feature dense transverse laminae and show a laminar
structures. The laminae are mainly composed of organic-rich
clay laminae and calcsparite laminae. Other characteristics
include high abundance of organic matter, good physical
properties, and excellent oil saturation. This type shales is the
major oil-generating lithofacies in the early exploration stage
and serves as the most favorable exploration target. The Class II
shales are mainly developed in laminated - bedded argillaceous
limestone that feat ures hor izontal bedding with loca l
enrichment of laminar structured formations. The laminae are
mainly composed of dispersed organic clay laminae and calcite
laminae (sparite and micritic). This type shale has relatively
poor abundance of organic matter, slightly poorer physical
properties and oil potential compared with that of Class I. It is
mainly distributed in the middle of Sequence 13 and 12. The
Class III shale, which has high content of argillaceous materials,
poor physical properties, low chloroform bitumen “A” content
as well as low oil and gas saturation, are mainly developed in
the bedded argillaceous limestone lithofacies and calcareous
mudstone lithofacies in the upper part of Sequence 10, 11, and
12 and the lower part of Sequence 13.
According to results from this study, three horizontal wells of
shale oil well drilled in the Luojia area including Boyeping 1,
2 and 3, to evaluate production capacities of shale oil and gas
in the laminated argillaceous limestone lithofacies with natural
fractures, bedded argillaceous limestone lithofacies without

79

Y.Wang et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 1,70-80

natural fractures, and laminated - bedded argillaceous limestone
lithofacies with natural fractures, respectively. Well Boyeping 1
has good oil and gas shows in the shale formation with a daily
production of oil equivalent of 7.8 t. Due to high concentration
of hydrogen sulfide and formation over-pressure (pressure
coefficient 1.82), the targeted favorable formation has collapsed
in favourable interval of Well Boyeping1.
The shale formations in different regions are influenced by
multi-factors such as depositional environment, evolution degree,
and tectonic activity. Such influences can lead to differences in
shale reservoirs regarding accumulation strata, lithofacies and
source rock characteristics, reservoir properties, oil and gas
saturation, as well as production capacity. Therefore, evaluation
criteria for shale oil and gas resources are region specific and
cannot be generalized. But the proposed workflow has certain
practicability in shale exploration in continental rift basins and
may have a broad application for such basin type.
