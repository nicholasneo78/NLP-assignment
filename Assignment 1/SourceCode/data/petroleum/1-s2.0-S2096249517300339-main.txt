the Pleistocene (1.81 Ma to present). In the late Middle Miocene (~11.6 Ma), the rudiment of CCS
was developed by a regional tectonic transformation in the eastern part of the basin. In the Early
Pliocene, the CCS was further developed from west to east and restrained in the central depression
belt of the basin due to abundant sediment supplies from the northwestern and northern provenances,
the blocking effect of the southern uplift belt, and the restrictive geomorphological features of the
eastern part of the basin. In the Late Pliocene, changes in the sedimentary environment resulted in the
development of the CCS in the eastern part of the basin only. Since the Pleistocene, the joint action of
climatic factors and geomorphological features of the eastern part of the basin led to the rejuvenation
of the CCS.

the Yinggehai Basin to the west, the Peal River Mouth Basin to the
northeast, and the northwest sub-basin to the east (Fig. 1). From the
north to the south, the QDNB tectonic belt can be divided into the
following regional tectonic units, i.e., the northern depression belt,
the central uplift belt, the central depression belt, and the southern
uplift belt (Fig. 1). Of these, the central depression and southern
uplift belts are located in the deep-water zone.

the presence of the Central Canyon System (CCS) in the basin. The
CCS is a large-scale axial canyon developed on an abyssal plain
with its main body lying in the central depression belt of QDNB.
Previous researches on the CCS has primarily focused on the
description of its morphological characteristics and depiction of its

et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Su et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2014c, 2015).
Presently, there remains substantial controversy over formation
mechanism and controlling factors of the CCS. In particular, there
is a lack of systematic research on sedimentary evolution of the
CCS. In this study, we characterize geomorphology and describe
the internal architectures of the CCS by interpreting large quantity
two- and three-dimensional (2D - 3D) seismic data that cover the
canyon area in QDNB, thus the changes from the west to the east
in the CCS are well revealed systematically. In view of the tectonosedimentary characteristics of QDNB since the Late Miocene, the
formation and development of the CCS from the Late Miocene
are divided into four stages, further elucidating the sedimentary
evolution history of the large-scale deep-water axial canyon system.

The major infill sequences of QDNB are of Cenozoic strata,
including the Eocene and Oligocene Yacheng and Lingshui
formations, the Miocene Sanya, Meishan, and Huangliu
formations, the Pliocene Yinggehai Formation, and the
Quaternary strata (Fig. 2). The unconformity boundary S60
(23.0 Ma) divides the Cenozoic strata into the upper and
lower structural layers that respectively represent products of
rifting and post-rift thermal subsidence (Gong et al., 1997).
The post-rift infilling can further be divided into a thermal
subsidence stage and an accelerated subsidence stage with the
unconformity S40 (11.6 Ma) as the boundary (Su et al., 2011).
Corresponding to the division of the three tectonic evolutionary
stages, QDNB underwent two significant environmental
changes in the Late Oligocene (23.0 Ma) and the Late Miocene
(11.6 Ma), respectively. That is, the basin sequence changed
from alluvial and lacustrine facies to littoral neritic facies and
further to bathyal - abyssal facies (Xie et al., 2006). During
the accelerate subsidence stage, tectonic movements in QDNB
tended to stabilize and sediment supply from the northwestern

and western basin was abundant, leading to the formation of
the continental shelf - slope system with distinct characteristics
(Wang et al., 2008; He et al., 2010).

3 Geomorphological characteristics
3.1 Planar distribution
The CCS was developed in QDNB during the accelerated
subsidence stage in the post-rift period. The canyon lies in the
central depression belt of QDNB and extends along the Ledong
- Lingshui sag, Songnan low-high, Songnan - Baodao sag, and
Changchang sag from west to east (Fig. 3a). The canyon is
about 425 km in length and 9‚Äì30 km in width. It parallels to
the slope in an S shape and is nearly NE-trending (Fig. 3a) (Su
et al., 2009, 2014a). There exists a turning point in the eastern
part of the basin (i.e., seamount developed at the junction of
the Songnan - Baodao and Changchang sags) in terms of the
extending direction, width variation, and winding degree of the
canyon. The geomorphological parameters of the canyon show
VLJQL√ÄFDQWGLIIHUHQFHVEHWZHHQWKHHDVWDQGZHVWRIWKHWXUQLQJ
point: to the west of the turning point, the canyon extends
toward NE direction with a broad width of 16‚Äì30 km and a
winding degree up to 1.098; to the east of the turning point, the
canyon extends toward NEE direction with a narrow width of
9‚Äì14 km and a winding degree of 1.010 (Table 1).

is belt-like and distributed on the abyssal plain of the Changchang
sag in the eastern part of the basin (Fig. 3a). After projecting the

show no obvious swing or migration, indicating the good vertical
inheritance (Su et al., 2009, 2014a, 2015, 2014a, 2015). In the
western part of the basin, evidence of the present CCS development
is absent along the seafloor thalweg in the geomorphologic map.
Palaeogeomorphic restoration and canyon bottom boundary
delineation indicate that in the western part of the basin, the CCS
was developed in the Early Pliocene (5.7‚Äì3.7 Ma), corresponding

distribution of the CCS further proves that the canyon in QDNB
has experienced multi-stages evolution from the Late Miocene to
present.

3.2 Cross-section
Similar to those of other abyssal canyon systems around the world
(Popescu et al., 2004; Ridente et al., 2007; Tibor et al., 2010;
Chiang et al., 2011), the cross-section of the CCS in QDNB shows
U- and V-shaped patterns. In addition to the above two end-member
morphological types, the CCS shows more geomorphological
features (Figs. 3c - e). Based on seismic data interpretation, the CCS
in QDNB is divided into three types and six patterns in terms of the
cross-sectional geomorphology, i.e., U, V, and U-V composite. The
composite type is further divided into the following four sub-types,
lower V - upper W, lower U - upper U, lower U - upper V, and
coexisting U-V (Su et al., 2009). Additionally, seismic interpretation
reveals that the variations in geomorphologies of the CCS cross-

section features from west to east (Fig. 3). In the initial development
area, i.e., the most western the Ledong - Lingshui sag in the western
part of the basin, the canyon is U-shape (Fig. 3b); in the the western
part of the basin, the canyon commonly shows composite features
(Figs. 3c - e); in the eastern part of the basin, the canyon is V-shape
(Figs. 3f - i). The geomorphological turning point of the CCS in the
cross-section corresponds to that observed in the planar distribution
of the canyon.

3.3 Segmentation
Based on the above description of the CCS in QDNB regarding
the extensional trend, width, winding degree, cross-sectional
geomorphology and distribution, the CCS has apparent features of
segmentation (Su et al., 2014a). From west to east, the CCS can be
divided into three segments, i.e., canyon head - the initial region
of canyon development, the western segment, and the eastern
segment. The canyon head is situated at the western Ledong
- Lingshui sag, and the boundary of the western - and eastern
segments is the turning point, that is, the seamount at the junction
of the Songnan - Baodao and Changchang sags (Fig. 3a). The CCS

84

shows different geomorphologies in various segments, possibly due
to effect of a combination of factors such as tectonic movement,
palaeogeomorphological feature, multi-source sediment supply, and
susceptibility to post-depositional alteration.

4 Internal architecture
4.1 Characterization and interpretation of internal
structural unit - seismic facies
Through detailed interpretation of 2D - 3D seismic data, 12
types of seismic facies are recognized in the CCS in terms of

described and interpreted below.
Seismic Facies A is a set of chaotic reflection events with low
- medium amplitude and poor continuity that are generally
distributed on the base boundary of the canyon and most
commonly found in the canyon head. According to the
comparative analysis with the internal architecture of deepwater turbidite channels (Mayall and Stewart, 2000), the Seismic

and good continuity, presumably representing a set of vertically
superimposed sand-rich turbidite channel sand bodies. This set
of reflectors is widely developed in the canyon head, thus can
be used as a mark for identification of turbidite channels (Fig.
4c). Seismic Facies D shows sub-parallel reflection features
with high amplitude and good continuity, which constituents

unconformities (erosional discordances) are commonly observed
in this seismic facies, reflecting the erosion and incision along
with the channel migration and swing (Fig. 4d). Seismic Facies
D and E have similar reflection configurations; the difference
lies in the gull-wing-like external geomorphology of Seismic
Facies E. Accordingly, the seismic facies E often was regarded
as the natural levees or overbank deposits (Gong et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2011). However, this set of deposits generally shows highamplitude seismic reflection that more similar to the reflection
characteristics of Seismic Facies D. Thus, the Seismic Facies E

of high amplitude and good continuity, presumably representing
a set of small turbidite channels. Such small-scale seismic facies
is distributed locally (Fig. 4f). Seismic Facies G has parallel,
layered reflection configuration with high amplitude and good
continuity. This seismic facies is interpreted as sand sheets
which generally coexist with small turbidite channels (Fig. 4g).

reflection characteristics of chaotic moderate amplitude. This
set of sedimentary structures is widely developed in deep-water
sediments in QDNB since the Neogene and have some erosion
and scouring capabilities in certain areas (Fig. 4i). Additionally,
this set of structures shows the typical characteristics of MTC
(mass transport complex) (He et al., 2011). Seismic Facies J shows

reflecting the characteristics of abyssal fine-grained deposits
(Fig. 4j). Seismic Facies K is a set of chaotic to blank transparent
reflection events that are generally located on the side-wall of
V-shape canyon and is commonly found in the Changchang
sag. This set of seismic facies is collapse deposits formed by
gravity driven destabilization of sediments. Seismic Facies L is a

found in the CCS in the eastern Changchang sag. This set of

- erosion interface commonly found in the western segment,
internal unconformity interfaces are generally not observed
in Seismic Facies L, which is interpreted as sand sheet-MTC
complex (Fig. 4a).

4.2 Division of sedimentary cycles
For deep-water canyons / channels, the minimum isochronous
unit that can be used for horizontal contrast usually depends on
TXDOLW\RIGDWD VHLVPLFZHOOFRUHDQGRXWFURS DQGDLPRIVSHFL√ÄF
research. In QDNB, the CCS features multi-stage sedimentary
evolution and shows variations in the geomorphology and
internal architectures from west to east. Hence, that is to say the
sedimentary cycles is required to identify the internal architectural
units, describes the canyon characteristics, and compares different
segments in a relative isochronous framework.
In the study, a classification scheme of stratigraphic cycles /
complex / sedimentary event / seismic structural unit is used for

part of the basin, two turbidite channel complexes and two
MTC complexes are recognized, which respectively constitute
two fining-upward cycles, as two stratigraphic cycles (Fig.
5b). According to the turbidite content of the two stratigraphic
cycles, the turbidity energy is less in the upper cycle than in the
lower cycle. In the eastern part of the basin, five stratigraphic
cycles are recognized since the Late Miocene despite impact of
the low data resolution (Fig. 5c). Considering different stages of
the canyon from west to east, we selected different minimum
isochronous units for three CCS segments, i.e., channel event
for the canyon head, complex for the western segment, and
stratigraphic cycle for the eastern segment.

5 Sedimentary evolution
Seven 3th-order sequence boundaries are identified in the
stratigraphic sequences of QDNB since the Late Miocene, i.e., S40,
S31, S30, S29, S28, S27, and S20. These boundaries divide the basin
(11.6 Ma to present) into seven 3th-order sequences (Fig. 2). Further
analysis of the internal architecture of the CCS demonstrates that

The early period of the Late Miocene (11.6 Ma) marks boundary
of thermal subsidence and accelerated subsidence stages in the
post-rift period of the basin and the interface between the Meishan
and Huangliu formations. This interface shows different features
between the eastern and western parts of the basin. In the shallow
water zone of the northwestern part of the basin, S40 generally
appears as an angular unconformity and truncates underlying
strata. Locally, the entire 1st member of the Meishan Formation has
been completely eroded. In the bathyal - abyssal zone of the eastern
part of the basin, there are distinct differences above and below
S40. Above this unconformity, a set of good-continuity moderateamplitude seismic reflection events correspond to the bathyal -

deposition. Previous researches have described or calculated
the seismic reflection configurations, relative sea-level change,
lithological properties, and tectonic subsidence rate, and proposed
that eastern QDNB experienced a regional tectonic transformation
event in 11. 6 Ma(Su et al., 2011). Further comparison of seismic
sections between the eastern segment of the CCS and the Xisha
Trough has demonstrated that both structures have following
features: (1) deep in east - shallow in west, (2) narrow in east - wide
in west, (3) steep trough wall, and (4) near WE-trending extension.

indication of accelerated subsidence of the trough since the Late
Miocene in the basin (Su et al., 2011).
As a result of the regional tectonic event, QDNB underwent
sudden subsidence in the early period of the Late Miocene,
thereby suddenly turning from the shallow water environment
to the bathyal - abyssal environment. Since the Late Miocene,
the basin gradually stabilized and the geomorphological
features were preserved to present, consistent with distribution
pattern of the present bathymetry (Fig. 3a). The sudden
change in the eastern part of the basin led to formation of the
geomorphological framework consisting of three uplifts and one
sag, i.e., the northern Shenhu uplift, and western seamount (the
abovementioned turning point at the junction of the Songnan
- Baodao sag and Changchang sag), and the southern Yongle
uplift. A narrow semi-closed sub-basin was formed in the center
of the eastern basin deepening eastward (Fig. 6). The Late
Miocene semi-closed depression provided potential space for
canyon formation since the Pliocene and continuously played a
role in controlling evolution of the canyon in the eastern QDNB.
During the same period, sudden change in the eastern QDNB
and increasing water depth led to formation of the continental
shelf - slope system since the Late Miocene (11.6 Ma). The shelf
- slope system was initially developed in the eastern part of the
basin only, showing a broad, gentle progressive slope type (He
et al., 2010). Because of limited sediment supply capacity of the
broad, gentle progressive continental slope, the entire eastern part
of the basin lacked sufficient sediment supply and thus restricted
sediment thickness (Su et al., 2014b). Thin-layer sediments from the
continental slope did not have significant erosional ability. Thus,
after entering the semi-closed sub-basin of the eastern part of the
basin, the sediments might be vertically superimposed. In the Late
Miocene (11.6‚Äì5.7 Ma), the eastern part of the basin had formed
rudiment of the canyon (Fig. 6).

River and Hainan Island (Zhu et al., 2007), which further moved
to the junction of the Yinggehai Basin and QDNB (Fig. 7). Around
5.7 Ma, the sinistral strike-slip movement of Red River Fault
changed into dextral strike-slip movement (Leloup et al., 1995). The
tectonic change induced further enhancement of the hydrodynamic
conditions of the deposits. Along with long-distance transport of the

eroded underlying strata in the western QDNB and led to formation
of turbidity channels. These turbidity channels, as shown on seismic

widely developed in the canyon head (Figs. 4c and 5a). Presently,
it remains unclear whether sediment components of the turbidity
channels come from water system of the Red River or eastern
Vietnam, or the Hainan Island. Thus, the sediment source of the
set of turbidity channels are collectively called the northwestern

is formed in the canyon head. After entering the western QDNB,
the turbidity channels would movement from west to east but its
hydrodynamics experienced a weak - strong - weak evolution.
It must be noted that in the Early Pliocene (5.7‚Äì3.7 Ma), the
differences in the provenance supplying condition and continuous
movements of the Red River fault zone caused certain changes
in the northwestern provenance, leading to differences in the
development location, hydrodynamic conditions, geomorphological
features, and infilling characteristics of turbidite deposits at the
junction of the Yinggehai Basin and QDNB during the periods of
S30 - S29 (5.7‚Äì4.2 Ma) and S29 - S28 (4.2‚Äì3.7 Ma) (Fig. 7). Further
analysis of seismic section shows that in the period of S30 - S29
(5.7‚Äì4.2 Ma), the CCS in the western part of the basin had higher
WXUELGLW\FXUUHQWHQHUJ\DQGLQWHUQDOLQ√ÄOOVWUXFWXUHKDGIHDWXUHVRI
sand-rich vertically superimposed turbidity channel (Seismic Facies
C), frequently swinging turbidity channel (Seismic Facies D), and
residual channel sand body (Seismic Facies E). During the period
of S29 - S28 (4.2‚Äì3.7 Ma), turbidite deposits generally feature
small-scale turbidity channel (Seismic Facies F), sand sheet (Seismic
Facies G), and lobe structure (Seismic Facies H).
During this stage, the continental shelf - slope system in the basin
showed seaward progradation. In particular, prograding continental
slope, slumping slope, and channelized slope in the western part
of the basin could provide massive sediments dominated by MTC
(He et al., 2010). Sediments originating from the continental shelf
- slope system, called the northern provenance, infilled the CCS
in QDNB from north to south. Because of important supplies
of infill sediments, internal infill of the canyon featured multisources. Due to blocking effect of the southern uplift belt, the
Early Pliocene MTC originating from the northern provenance
was restrained within the canyon system and did not cross the
southern boundary of the canyon. Because of variations in factors
such as angle of MTC entering the canyon, the transport distance
from the continental slope to the canyon, and blocking effect of the

southern uplift, MTC possessed certain hydrodynamic potential in
local areas of the CCS, thus could erode the previously deposited
turbidite and lead to existence of residual channel sand body (e.g.,
Seismic Facies E). This feature is especially evident in the eastern
Ledong - Lingshui sag and Songnan - Baodao sag.
Following tectonic transformation in the early period of the Late
Miocene, a semi-closed sub-basin occurred in the central part
of the eastern part of the basin. Thereafter, the basin gradually
stabilized and experienced no significant tectonic movement,
thus preserving unique geomorphology. After entering the
CCS, sediments from northwestern and northern provenances
would move along the canyon from west to east and approached
the semi-closed environment in the eastern part of the basin
(Fig. 7). However, hydrodynamic potential was quite weak and
deposits captured by the eastern basin showed more features of
infill rather than significant scouring or erosion. In the Early
Pliocene, the broad, gentle progressive slope in the eastern part
of the basin still provided limited sediments, unlike the MTCdominating deposits provide in the western part of the basin.
Therefore, the internal infill of the CCS in the eastern basin
was generally characterized by sand sheet - MTC complex with
alternating features of good continuity- high amplitude and poor
continuity - weak amplitude. No evident erosion or scouring
structure was observed in the internal infill of the CCS in
eastern basin (Seismic Facies L). As the turbidity current energy
of the northwestern provenance declined in the western part of
the basin, the turbidite deposits were characterized by sand sheet

- lobate. After mixing with MTC from the northern provenance,
low-energy deposits approached the eastern part of the basin
and infilled the canyon in a cake-like layers under control of
restrictive geomorphological features (Fig. 5c).

obvious bottom boundary of MTC erosion (Fig. 4h). In the Late
Pliocene, the axial canyon or channels were not developed in the
eastern QDNB due to lack of the northwestern provenance and
intense supply from the northern provenance (Fig. 8).
During this stage, the eastern part of the basin inherited negative
topographic features and received the continental slope sediments
from the western part of the basin as well as continental slope
sediments from the eastern part of the basin. After entering the
eastern part of the basin, sediments tranquilly infilled the basin
from west to east and following geomorphological features of the

From the Pleistocene, the seaward progradation of the continental
shelf - slope system in QDNB was more obvious and massive
sediments entered lower continental slope - abyssal plain. During
this stage, the axial deep-water canyon was not developed in the
central depression belt in the western part of the basin. The present
seafloor geomorphological map clearly shows distribution range
of the present the CCS in the eastern part of the basin (Fig. 9).
In particular, a set of deposits with large thickness and distinct
features of turbidite channel are recognized on the seismic section
close to the turning point (Su et al., 2014c, 2015). Based on
interpretation and comparative analysis of periphery sections, a set
of deposits are sedimentary units developed since the Pleistocene
(1.81 Ma) to present, i.e., stratigraphic cycle 5 of the CCS in the
eastern segment (Fig. 5c). This phenomenon can be interpreted as
rejuvenation of the CCS since the Pleistocene primarily associated
with sufficient sediment supply. The Late Pliocene - Quaternary
period was associated with alternating glacial - interglacial periods,
during which sediment supply was intense in QDNB. The vertical
accumulation rate of continental slopes increased. In prograding
continental slopes, the slope migration line turned steeper. A
large number of continental slope canyons were developed in
slumping and channelized continental slopes (He et al., 2010).
A few small-scale continental slope gullies existed in the broad,
gentle progressive continental slopes in the southern Shenhu uplift

90

(Fig. 9). These observations could be related to climatic changes
since the Pleistocene, such as rapid climatic change called the MidPleistocene Revolution (MPR) (Pisias and Moore, 1981).
$VLQ√ÅXHQFHGE\FOLPDWHVLQFHWKH3OHLVWRFHQHDODUJHQXPEHU
of continental slope canyons were developed in slumping
and channelized continental slopes in QDNB, typically at
the junction of Songnan - Baodao and Changcahng sags.
The present seafloor geomorphological map shows presence
of continental slope canyons (Fig. 9). These continental
slope canyons transported sediments to the abyssal plain,
allowing formation of abyssal fans at the lower continental
slope. Seamount at the turning point played a role in dividing
sediments and preventing them from directly entering the
eastern part of the basin (Su et al., 2014c, 2015). The transport
direction of the remaining sediments experienced nearly 40¬∞
anticlockwise changes and was captured by the present CCS (Fig.
9). As confined by the semi-closed sub-basin, the sediments
moved along the pre-existing canyon from west to east. The
eastern segment had increasingly apparent negative terrains
toward the east. The canyon walls were steep on both sides. The
sediments could easily be destabilized to form slump deposits in
the canyon (Seismic Facies K).

6 Conclusions
(1) The CCS in QDNB features distinct segmentation and can be
divided into canyon head, eastern segment, and western segment

by multi-factors including tectonic transformation, tectonic
activities, sediment supply, geomorphological feature, and deepwater deposition. Different tectono-sedimentary environments of
QDNB in various segments and geological evolutionary stages led
to differential characteristics of the CCS in different locations. In
the Late Miocene (11.6 Ma), regional tectonic transformation in
the eastern part of the basin led to formation of a semi-closed subbasin, that is, rudiment of the canyon. In the Early Pliocene (5.7‚Äì3.7
Ma), abundant sediment from the northwestern and northern
provenances, blocking of the southern uplift belt, and restrictive
geomorphological features of the eastern part of the basin,
restrained development of the large-scale axial canyon system in
the central depression belt of QDNB. In the Late Pliocene (3.7‚Äì1.81
Ma), changes in the tectono-sedimentary environment resulted
in the distribution of the CCS in the eastern part of the basin
only. Since the Pleistocene (1.81 Ma to present), climatic changes
enhanced sediment supplying capacity and altered the eastern part
of the basin geomorphology, leading to a rejuvenation of the CCS.
