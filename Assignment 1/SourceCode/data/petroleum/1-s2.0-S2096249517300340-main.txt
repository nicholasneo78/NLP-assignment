Abstract: Based on distribution of formation pressure by indirect estimation and formation testing,
this study investigates origin of abnormal high pressure in the Dina 2 Gas Field in the Kuqa
Depression in combination with the latest research findings. Contribution of major overpressure
mechanisms to this gas field is estimated, and generation of the abnormal high pressure as well as its
relationship with natural gas accumulation is explored. Disequilibrium compaction, tectonic stress,
and overpressure transfer are the major overpressure mechanisms. Overpressure transfer resulted
from vertical opening of faults and folding is the most important cause for the overpressure. Gas
accumulation and abnormal high pressure generation in the reservoirs of the Dina 2 Gas Field show
synchroneity. During the early oil-gas charge in the Kangcun stage, the reservoirs were generally
normal pressure systems. In the Kuqa deposition stage, rapid deposition caused disequilibrium
compaction and led to generation of excess pressure (approximately 5–10 MPa) in the reservoirs.
During the Kuqa Formation denudation stage to the Quaternary, reservoir overpressure was greatly
increased to approximately 40–50 MPa as a result of vertical pressure transfer by episodic fault
activation, lateral overpressure transfer by folding and horizontal tectonic stress due to intense
tectonic compression. The last stage was the major period of ultra-high pressure generation and gas
accumulation in the Dina 2 Gas Field.

Key words: abnormal high pressure; overpressure transfer; tectonic
compression; Dina 2 Gas Field; Kuqa Depression

1 Introduction
The Dina 2 Gas Field, a major new discovery following the Kela
2 Gas Field in the Tarim Basin, is a large-scale coal-derived
gas field with a reserve of 100×109 m3(Yan et al., 2009). The
Dina 2 Gas Field is an ultra-high pressure gas field, which has
a formation pressure of 106 MPa and pressure coefficient of
2.14–2.29 in the central part (Ma et al., 2003). This gas field has

experienced intense tectonic compression in the Late Himalayan.
Previous studies indicated that the late Himalayan tectonic
compression imposed strong influences on ultrahigh pressure
generation in the Dina 2 Gas field (Ma et al., 2003; Sun et al.,
2004; Zeng et al., 2004a; Shi et al., 2007), but these researches
have mainly focused on fluid pressurization caused by tectonic
stress (Zeng et al., 2004a; Shi et al., 2007). In the context of

et al., 2004). The Kuqa Depression comprises several tectonic
units, and the Dina 2 Gas Field lies in the eastern Qiulitage
tectonic belt in the central part of the depression (Fig. 1) (Yan
et al.,2009). The development and evolution of the eastern
Qiulitage tectonic belt are controlled by the north-dipping
thrust faults developed in its south and north: one is the Dina
north fault developed in the Himalayan; the other is the eastern
Qiulitage fault initiated in the Yanshanian, continuously
evolving through the Himalayan, and for med the final
configuration in the Late Himalayan (Yan et al., 2009). Both
faults disappear upward in the gypsum mudstone sequences and
cut through downward into the basement. The two faults not
only control tectonic framework of the eastern Qiulitage tectonic
belt but also control generation of the Dina tectonic strata. The
faults connect to oil source kitchens but do not expose to the
ground surface, and thus are ideal conduits for vertical oil and
gas migration (Sun et al., 2004). Beneath the gypsum mudstone
and salt rock sequences of the Jidike Formation, the Mesozoic
- Cenozoic tectonic strata have developed fault-bend folds and
duplexes. The Dina-2 structure is a fault-bend fold of sub-salt
reservoirs of the Jidike Formation (Ma et al., 2003).

intense tectonic compression, overpressure transfer caused by
strata deformation (e.g. folding) and episodic opening of faults
can also lead to fluid pressurization (Osborne and Swarbrick,
1997; Liu, 2002; Luo, 2004a; Guo et al., 2010), which may
greatly influence hydrocarbon accumulation. Presently, there is
little work on the generation mechanism of ultra-high pressure
and its relationship to hydrocarbon accumulation under the joint
action of multi-factors in the context of tectonic compression.
An in-depth study on the issues is needed, especially for the
quantitative assessment and process analysis.
This study examines lateral distribution of pressure in
sandstone-mudstone formations in the Dina 2 Gas Field using
directly measured pressure data of permeable layers and
indirectly estimated pressure data in mudstone layers. Building
upon some already published work, a recognition model of
major overpressure mechanism is established. The origin of
abnormal high pressure in the Dina 2 Gas Field is discussed.
Additionally, relative contribution of major overpressure
mechanisms to the present abnormal high pressure is estimated
and the generation process of abnormal high pressure as well
as its relationship with gas accumulation in the gas field is
studied. Theses findings will improve understanding of origin of
abnormal high pressure under complex effect of multi-factors in
the foreland compression zones, and provide new insights into
generation mechanism of overpressure in the Dina 2 Gas Field,
thereby guiding regional hydrocarbon exploration.

In the Dina 2 Gas Field, source rocks are the Middle - Upper
Triassic and Jurassic coal measure formations. The reservoirs
are the lower Neogene Jidike Formation and the Paleogene
Kumugeliemu - Suweiyi formations, mainly composed of
sandstone, pebbly sandstone and siltstone. The reservoircap rock is a several hundred-meter-thick gypsum salt rock gypsum mudstone - mudstone interval of the Jidike Formation,
which has strong sealing capacity and forms good reservoir-cap
rock assemblages in the cross-section (Sun et al., 2004).

stages evolution. In the Pliocene, the eastern Qiulitage tectonic
belt rapidly deposited the strata (He et al., 2004). Since the
Late Pliocene, intense tectonic compression occurred N- to
S-trending in the basin, leading to generation of stress field of
the maximum principal horizontal stress (Zeng et al., 2004b).
The tectonic compression was associated with high-magnitude
uplift and erosion, large-scale faulting and closely related
intense fold deformation (Li et al., 2008). The above tectonic
activities played a crucial role in controlling distribution and
evolution of formation fluid pressure in the study area.

associated with overpressure to strong overpressure (Fig. 2). The
Paleogene and Neogene formations are both associated with
strong overpressure, with the pressure coefficient of 1.93–2.26
and relatively high excess pressure of 48.8–55.9 MPa. In the deep
Cretaceous formations, formation testing is only performed in
Well ND 11 where the pressure coefficient drops to 1.5–1.7 with
corresponding excess pressure of 26–33 MPa. In the DN 2, DN
201, DN 202, and DN 204 at Dina 2 wells, excess pressure is
generally within range of 52–55 MPa and occasionally at 48.8
MPa in reservoirs of the Paleogene Kumugeliemu Formation.
The excess pressure is 53.5–54.5 MPa in the reservoirs of the
Paleogene Suweiyi Formation and 50.8 MPa at the only pressure
testing point in the reservoirs of the Neogene Jidike Formation.
The above results show that the excess pressure in the Paleogene

4 Origin of abnormal high pressure
Overpressure generation and development mechanisms are
complex and can be classified into compaction disequilibrium
and unloading (Ramdhan and Goulty, 2011). Herein, unloading
refers to pressurization that tends to reduce vertical effective
stress. The major unloading mechanisms of overpressure are
fluid expansion, tectonic stress, and overpressure transfer.
Fluid expansion is primarily caused by gas generation,
hydrothermal pressurization, and clay mineral dehydration
(Bowers, 2002; Ramdhan and Goulty, 2011). Previous numerical
simulations demonstrated that pressurization from hydrothermal
pressurization and clay mineral dehydration is weak and
negligible (Luo, 2000). In the widely developed source rock, gas
generation can cause a wide-range of overpressure (Tingay et al.,
2009). As for the reservoirs, the major unloading mechanisms of
overpressure are tectonic stress and overpressure transfer.

Under action of vertical disequilibrium compaction, porosity
generally remains unchanged (Fig. 3a). Variations in fluid
pressure with depth approximately parallels to that of the
lithostatic pressure(Tingay et al., 2009; Ramdhan and Goulty,
2011) (Fig. 3b); variations in the vertical effective stress and
porosity of the overpressured formations comply with normal
compaction relationship (Fig. 3c) (Tingay et al., 2009), and
variation relationship should be exponential (Luo, 2004a). The
variation relationship can be expressed as follows:

  0 eb

(1)

Where φ 0 is the surface porosity,%; φ is the porosity at a certain
depth, %; b is a constant; and δ is the effective stress at the same
depth, MPa.
Equation (1) can be transformed into

 1  0 1eb

(2)

According to equation (2), the recognition model of Tingay et al
(2009) is modified by replacing the DC trend line to the DC-X

trend line (Fig. 3c). After fluid pressurization is caused by fluid
expansion, overpressure transfer, and tectonic stress, changes in
porosity related to tectonic stress may be relatively larger and those
related to fluid expansion and overpressure transfer are smaller. All
of the pressurization processes can contribute to reduction of the
vertical effective stress. Thus, variations in the vertical effective
stress and porosity of the overpressured formation should deviate
from the exponential curve, as shown in the FE trend line (Fig. 3c)
(Tingay et al., 2009). Accordingly, the unloading mechanism for
overpressure can be recognized based on variation relationship
between porosity (or acoustic velocity) and vertical effective stress
of the overpressured formation.

4.1 Disequilibrium compaction
Pressurization mechanism of compaction can be classified into
two geological factors, the relatively thick low-permeability
formation and the relatively rapid overlying load deposition
(Audet and McConnell, 1992; Luo et al, 2004).
The eastern Paleogene formations of the Qiulitage tectonic
belt have mainly developed fan delta and lake facies, with
lagoon facies locally. The Paleogene Kumugeliemu Group
has a drilling thickness of 146–192 m and its average ratio of
mudstone thickness-to-stratum thickness (M/S) is 40%. The
Paleogene Suweiyi Formation is drilled to 184–218.5 m and its
average ratio of mudstone thickness to stratum thickness is 35%
(Yan et al., 2009). The Neogene Jidike Formation develops a
1400-m-thick interval of gypsum-salt rock, gypsum-mudstone,
and mudstone with low permeability, thus providing a good
regional seal for the Dina 2 Gas Field. The low-permeability

mudstone constitute+s an environment for abnormal pressure
generation.
Since the Neogene, subsidence rate of the eastern Qiulitage
tectonic belt has apparently increased. The subsidence rate was
<50 m/Ma in the Triassic to Paleogene, approximately 175 m/Ma
in Well Dongqiu 5 adjacent to Dina-2 Gas Field in the Jidike stage,
and approximately 133 m/Ma in Well Dongqiu 5 in the Kangcun
stage; subsidence rate of the Yangxia Sag at southern Dina 2 Gas
Field in the Kuqa stage was approximately 1286 m/Ma, and the
subsidence rate of the Dina 2 Gas Field during the Kuqa stage was
estimated to be approximately 1000 m/Ma (He et al., 2004). Such
rapid deposition allowed generation of overpressure in the Jidike
Formation as well as its underlying formation of low permeability
gypsum-mudstone and mudstone.
Based on analysis of mudstone compaction process, the
abnormal pressure is estimated in the mudstone formation
caused by disequilibrium compaction using a depth balancing
method (Luo et al., 2004). The mudstone compaction curves
show that in DN11, DN 22, and DN 202 wells, the acoustic
travelling time difference starts to deviate from normal
compaction trend line from the Jidike Formation (Fig. 4), and
abnormal high pressure exists in the mudstone. The generation
of abnormal high pressure in mudstone is generally related
to regional deposition of large intervals of thick mudstone
formation, and the rapid deposition during the Kuqa stage
led to generation of abnormal high pressure in the mudstone.
The upper boundary of the abnormal pressure belt at Dina2, is basically that of the Jidike Formation, which is widely
distributed (Fig. 5). The magnitude of excess pressure in the

4.2 Pressurization of tectonic stress

mudstone of the upper Jidike Formation is relatively large, with
the maximum pressure coefficient generally within range of 1.6–
1.7 and the maximum excess pressure up to 25 MPa. In certain
wells such as Well DN 11, the maximum pressure coefficient
of the upper mudstone of the Jidike Formation is up to 1.8–2.0
and the maximum excess pressure reaches 45 MPa (Fig. 5). The
excess pressure declines to 5–15 MPa in the mudstone of the
lower Jidike Formation and Paleogene to Cretaceous formations,
with the pressure coefficient generally in the range of 1.1–1.3.

Being a major overpressure mechanism, tectonic stress has
received substantial attention in recent years, however, related
studies on tectonic stress have primarily focused on qualitative
evaluations with few quantitative evaluations of overpressure
mechanism (Berry, 1973; Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997;
Luo et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005; Bilotti and Shaw, 2005;
Feyzullayev and Lerche, 2009). Tectonic stress does not act

directly on sediment particles but function through compaction
of the formation pressure. Thus, the action of tectonic stress
to formation pressure is considered to be lateral compaction
(Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997; Luo et al., 2007).
During the late Himalayan, the maximum principal stress in
the study area changed direction to horizontal. The tectonic
deformation at the southern Tianshan Mountains and the basinmountain boundary was dominated by nearly N-S-trending
compressional deformation, whereas in the Kuqa Depression,
nearly NS- and NW-SE-trending compressional deformation
was the dominating tectonic deformation (Wang et al., 2003).
The maximum effective principal stress in the Late Himalayan
was investigated by the acoustic emission experiments (Zeng
et al., 2004b; Zhang et al., 2004). Comparative analysis
demonstrated that the horizontal effective principal stress was
greater than the vertical effective principal stress, proving that
the Kuqa Depression experienced intense tectonic compression
in the late Himalayan. Tectonic stress accomplished compaction
through lateral compaction, which, combined with vertical
compaction, led to generation of obvious abnormal pressure
in the Jidike Formation (pressure coefficient up to 2.0, excess
pressure up to 45 MPa). The abnormal pressure resulted from
tectonic compaction of mudstone is relatively low in other
formations (Fig. 4). Assuming that the maximum excess
pressure generated by total compaction of the Jidike Formation
is completely transferred to the underlying formation, it is still
insufficient to generate such high excess pressure at Dina 2
Gas Field (Fig. 2). When comparing the measured pressure of
sandstone layer and the compaction curve estimated pressure of
the adjacent mudstone layer in the same well, great differences
between two sets of data are observed: the measured pressure of
sandstone layer is generally greater than the calculated pressure
of mudstone layer (Fig. 4).
Based on the concept of tectonic compaction, previous work
has established a quantitative evaluation model for f luid
pressurization caused by tectonic compaction under actual
formation conditions (Zhang et al., 2011)

Δp = ξ (σ 1 − S)

(3)

Where Δp is the fluid pressurization caused by tectonic stress,
MPa; σ1is the largest horizontal principal stress, MPa; S is the
load prior to pressurization, MPa; ζ is the sealing coefficient
that measures the actual sealing ability of the underground
geologic body (0–1; 0 represents a completely open fluid system,
and 1 represents a completely sealed fluid system).
The evaluation results show that fluid pressurization caused
by tectonic stress in the Cretaceous formations is relatively
small in the Well DN 201 (1.2 MPa) and Well DN 202 (1.3
MPa) (Zhang et al., 2011). Following equation (3), the fluid
pressurizeation caused by tectonic stress in the Cretaceous

98

formations in the Well DN 204 is estimated to be approximately
1. 5 MPa. The maximum horizontal principal stress of the
Cretaceous formations in the Well DN 11 and Well DN101 are
less than the overlying loads, indicating that the tectonic stress
in the Cretaceous formation of the DN 1 anticline at eastern
Dina 2 Gas Field basically causes no fluid pressurization.
As for the Cretaceous and Paleogene reservoirs at the same
tectonic position and with the same tectonic morphology, the
fluid pressurization caused by tectonic stress is quite similar.
Overall, the fluid pressurization caused by tectonic stress in the
Paleogene reservoirs at Dina area is low, e.g., <2 MPa, whereas
the tectonic stress in the DN 1 anticline basically causes no fluid
pressurization.

4.3 Pressurization of overpressure transfer
Previous studies on the overpressure generation mechanism
have found that over pressure transfer has played an important
role in the generation of abnormal high pressure in the Brunei
Baram region, and China’s Junggar, Bohai Bay and Yingge Sea
basins (Audet and McConnell, 1992; Liu, 2002; Luo, 2004b;
Tingay et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010). Folding can cause ununiform changes in the overlying load along the horizontal
direction, whereas different generation conditions of formation
pressure in the lateral direction lead to fluctuations of formation
depth. Formations sharing the same permeability are in contact
with those of different excess pressures, resulting in generation
of fluid pressure and lateral fluid migration (Luo et al., 2004).
Deep overpressure will drive fluid migration up-dip and thus
overpressure transfer, leading to generation of overpressure in
the up-dip part of permeable sand bodies (Liu, 2002). When
a fault cuts through two overpressure systems with different
excess pressures, reactivation of the fault will allow fluid to
flow along the fault conduits, thereby rapidly adjust excess
pressure and lead shallow formation (previously with low excess
pressure) to form relatively high overpressure (Osborne and
Swarbrick, 1997; Liu, 2002; Luo, 2004a; Guo et al., 2010).
The Dina 2 structure is a fault-bend fold of sub-salt reservoirs
of the Jidike Formation, which has oil-bearing faults developed
in the south and north sides. The formation of folds could cause
the lateral overpressure transfer in the sub-salt reservoirs of
the Jidike Formation that shared the same permeability and
pressurization of the excess pressure in the upper reservoirs
of the anticline with the same permeability (Fig. 6). Oil and
gas sources were accumulated the Middle - Upper Triassic
and Jurassic formations. Rapid burial in the Pliocene to
Quaternary led to fast hydrocarbon generation of the Triassic
and Jurassic source rocks (Sun et al., 2004). The process of
hydrocarbon generation caused fluid pressure increases in the
source rock formation (Barker, 1990; Osborne and Swarbrick,
1997). During the rapid burial period, the deep source rock
formations and the upper Paleogene to Neogene formations

Fig. 6 Overpressure transfer in the north-south section of the
Dina 2 structure, in the Dina 2 Gas Field, Kuqa Depression
(Sun et al., 2004)

The overpressure that is caused by overpressure transfer
via fault connection can be evaluated in view of following
geological phenomena: (1) a hydrostatic pressure gradient is
maintained between the upper and lower formations connected
by faults; (2) pressure coefficient of the shallow formation is
extremely high; (3) great pressure difference between permeable
formation and wall rock; and (4) a thin upper transition zone
of the overpressured formations (Luo, 2004b). In the Dina 2
Gas Field, the excess pressure occurs in the sub-salt Paleogene
and Neogene reservoirs of the Jidike Formation. The Dina 2
structure is relatively low. Excluding one point of the Neogene
Jidike Formation in the Dina 2 Gas Field, all of testing points
have excess pressure <3 MPa (Fig. 2). The upper and lower
formations connected by faults generally maintain a hydrostatic
pressure gradient. Sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike Formation in
the Dina 2 structure have an extremely high pressure coefficient,
and shallow reservoirs have an even greater pressure coefficient
than deep reservoirs (Fig. 2). As compared to the surrounding
mudstone, the sub-salt reservoir of the Jidike Formation in the
Dina 2 structure has relatively the large excess pressure (Fig. 4).
All above observations suggest that overpressure transfer of the
Dina 2 structure along faults is one of the key mechanisms for
the abnormal high pressure generation in the sub-salt reservoirs
of the Jidike Formation.
With the measured geological data of the Dina 2 Gas Field, a

normal compaction fitted trend line is achieved with vertical
effective stress and acoustic velocity of normal compaction
points, and then projections of the vertical effective stress and
acoustic velocity of the abnormal pressure points are done in a
coordinate system. The results show that the data points of the
vertical effective stress vs acoustic velocity apparently deviate
from the normal compaction trend line, and degree of deviation
is quite large (Fig. 7).

were subject to pressurization of hydrocarbon generation in
addition to the similar pressurized conditions. Therefore, the
deep source rock formations formed greater excess pressure
than the overlying formations during the rapid burial period.
During the intense tectonic compression in the late Himalayan,
the faults experienced episodic opening and each opening event
would allow rapid adjustment between the relatively high excess
pressure in the deep source rock of overpressure system and the
relatively low excess pressure in sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike
Formation. That is, the vertical overpressure transfer occurred
and thus increased the excess pressure in the sub-salt reservoirs
of the Jidike Formation. Such pressurization process was
commonly associated with lateral transfer (Fig. 6).

Field of the Kuqa Depression

Based on the above analysis, the tectonic stress and overpressure
transfer jointly are considered to cause the fluid pressurization
in the sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike Formation. Assuming
that after the late Himalayan fluid pressurization caused by
unloading, the formation porosity was unchanged, then the
corresponding acoustic velocity remained basically unchanged
as well. With this hypothesis, the reduction of vertical effective
stress resulted from fluid pressurization by tectonic stress and
the overpressure transfer can be quantified. The reduction of the
vertical effective stress is due to the fluid pressurization caused
by the tectonic stress and overpressure transfer (Table 1). Results
show that the overpressure transfer caused relatively large fluid
pressurization, generally in the range of 40–50 MPa, accounting
for 65%–90% of the measured excess pressure with an average
of 81.2% (Table 1). The pressurized hydraulic fluid caused by
the compaction and horizontal tectonic stress can be obtained
from the excess pressure in the adjacent mudstone formations
(Table 1). As compared to the measured excess pressure, sum of
estimated pressurization generated by different mechanisms has
an absolute error <8 MPa (generally <5 MPa) and an relative
error <15% (generally <10%). The estimates of pressurization
generated via different overpressure mechanisms generally
show small differences from the measured excess pressures,
thus are considered reliable. According to the estimated fluid
pressurization generated by different overpressure mechanisms,

the overpressure transfer appears to be the major cause for the

5 G enerat ion proce ss of abnor mal
high pressure and its relationship with
hydrocarbon accumulation
Previous studies have investigated hydrocarbon accumulation in
the Kuqa Depression, and a two-stage accumulation model was
proposed with an early oil accumulation followed by a late gas
charge. It has been suggested that the Early Miocene (23–12 Ma)
was the major oil accumulation period, whereas the Pliocene
(5–0 Ma), especially the Kuqa stage (2.5 Ma) was the major gas
accumulation period (Liang et al., 2002; Zhao and Lu, 2003).
Additionally, a three-stage hydrocarbon accumulation model
has also been proposed as follows: Neogene early - middle
Kangcun stage (17–10 Ma), late Kangcun stage to early - middle
Kuqa stage (10–3 Ma), and late Kuqa stage to Late Quaternary
period (3–1 Ma) (Zhao and Dai, 2002). The results of the K-Ar
isotope dating analysis with two authigenic illite samples from
the Paleogene sandstone reservoir in Well DN 22 showed that
ages of the illite are 11.3 ± 1.4 and 10.4 ± 1.2 Ma, corresponding
to the middle Kangcun stage. The results of previous analyses
of the hydrocarbon generation history indicated that the Middle
- Upper Triassic source rock in the Yangxia Sag entered the
early maturity stage in the Paleogene, peak oil generation stage
in the Neogene - Late Miocene (approximately 5 Ma), and overmaturity stage since the Pliocene - Quaternary due to a rapid
burial. The Jurassic source rock entered the peak oil generation
period in the Neogene - Late Miocene, mature and over-mature
in the Pliocene - Quaternary, and peak gas generation in the
Late Pliocene (Sun et al., 2004). In summary, the Dina 2 Gas
Field experienced an early oil-gas charge during the Kangcun
stage, and a late natural gas charge mainly in the late Kuqa
stage (5 Ma). The latter appears to be the key hydrocarbon
accumulation period for the Dina 2 Gas Field.
In the late Kangcun stage, a low-magnitude structure was

100

-0.04

formed in the Dina area and the deep source rock formation
entered peak oil generation stage. Hydrocarbon generation led
to formation of abnormal high pressure, and high-pressure oilgas was charged into the upper sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike
Formation. Despite the excellent sealing capacity of the gypsumsalt rocks of the Jidike Formation, the Dina low-magnitude
structure had good reservoir properties such as porosity,
permeability and lateral continuity, thus had poor lateral sealing
of the reservoir. After the high-pressure oil and gas was charged
into reservoirs of the Dina low-magnitude structure, it was
difficult to generate abnormal high pressure and reservoirs
retained normal pressure system due to poor lateral sealing. In
this period, low-magnitude structural oil-gas reservoirs were
formed (Fig. 8a).
In the Kuqa stage, deep source rock entered into mature and over
mature stages. Undercompaction and hydrocarbon generation led
to generation of ultra-high pressure with great excess pressure.
Due to rapid deposition, the gypsum-salt rocks of the overlying
Jidike Formation formed relatively high abnormal pressure, thereby
enhancing its sealing capacity. In the sub-salt reservoirs of the
Jidike Formation, a relatively sealed system was formed under
effects of diagenesis, lateral sealing of faults, and vertical sealing of
cap rocks. Compaction disequilibrium resulted in a low magnitude
of excess pressure (approximately 5–10 MPa). During this period,
tectonic activity was not intense and reactivation of faults was
relatively weak. The deep high-pressure gas could only slowly
charge into the sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike Formation along
faults, without producing the overpressure transfer. Therefore,
only a low magnitude of overpressure was formed in the sub-salt
reservoirs of the Jidike Formation in this period, and the previously
formed low-magnitude structural oil-gas reservoirs were subject
to slow gas flushing by deep natural gas, thus remaining as lowmagnitude oil-gas reservoirs (Fig. 8b).
During denudation stage of the Kuqa Formation to the
Quaternary, the study area experienced intense tectonic
compression and episodic opening of faults. Deep source rock
formations generated even higher excess pressure due to gas

generation. The resulting overpressured natural gas was charged
into the upper reservoirs with the lower excess pressure, and the
overpressure transfer led to increases in the excess pressure in
the upper sub-salt reservoirs. As faults might have experienced
multi-stage openings, the vertical overpressure transfer would
cause multiple-f luid pressurization in the upper sub-salt
reservoirs. During this period, intense tectonic compression
resulted in stratigraphic deformation and folding, which caused
lateral overpressure transfer into the reservoirs. Additionally, the
lateral compaction of relatively large horizontal tectonic stress
enhanced the compaction disequilibrium. All above conditions
would increase magnitude of abnormal pressure in the sub-salt
reservoirs of the Jidike Formation. In summary, under action of
intense tectonic compression, the vertical overpressure transfer
formed by episodic opening of faults, the lateral overpressure
transfer caused by folding, and the horizontal tectonic stress
significantly increased magnitude of abnormal pressure in
sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike Formation during the Kuqa
Formation denudation stage to the Quaternary, and formed an
excess pressure of approximately 40–50 MPa. This stage was
the major period of ultra-high pressure generation in the Dina
2 Gas Field. Additionally, the intense tectonic compression led
to formation of the large-magnitude faulted anticline structure

in this field, and rapid charge of deep overpressured-gas
transformed the pre-existing oil-gas reservoirs into the present
Dina 2 gas reservoirs (Fig. 8c).

6 Conclusions
(1) The major generation mechanisms of abnormal high pressure
in the Dina 2 Gas Field include disequilibrium compaction,
tectonic stress, and overpressure transfer. The overpressure
transfer resulted from vertical opening of faults and folding are
the primary causes for the abnormal high pressure in this gas
field with an estimated contribution of 65–90%.
(2) The reservoirs of the Dina 2 Gas Field were a normal
pressure system during the early oil-gas charge in the Kangcun
stage (17-5Ma). During the Kuqa stage (5-2Ma), a rapid
deposition caused compaction disequilibrium and formed
an excess pressure of approximately 5–10 MPa. During
denudation stage of the Kuqa Formation to the Quaternary,
vertical overpressure transfer from episodic opening of faults,
the lateral overpressure transfer due to folding, and the lateral
tectonic stress under an intense tectonic compression setting
significantly increased magnitude of the abnormal pressure in
the sub-salt reservoirs of the Jidike Formation and formed an
excess pressure of approximately 40–50 MPa. This is the major
overpressure generation period for the Dina 2 Gas Field.
(3) The present Dina 2 gas reservoirs were formed along with
generation of ultra-high pressure in the reservoir formations, that
is, the two processes were synchronous. The field area formed
the normal pressure reservoirs in the low magnitude anticline
during the late Kangcun stage (10-5Ma), the low overpressure
reservoirs in the low magnitude anticline during the Kuqa stage,
and the ultra-high pressure natural gas reservoirs in the large
magnitude anticline during the denudation stage of the Kuqa
Formation to the Quaternary.
