Abstract: Lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the gentle slope (ramp) area of Qikou Sag are highly
heterogeneous. Some researches about characteristics and distribution of these high quality reservoirs
are less. In this study, an integrated investigation was conducted on the high-quality lacustrine carbonate
reservoirs in the ramp area of Qikou Sag based on data of thin section examination, lithological log
response, testing results, and mercury-injection capillary pressure measurement. In the study area,
grainstone reservoirs in the lower 1st member of the Shahejie Formation are high-quality reservoirs
characterized by high - medium porosity, moderate permeability, low displacement pressure, and relative
large pore throat. Lithologically, these reservoirs are mainly composed of bioclastic and oolitic sparite, and
reservoir storage space consists of secondary intergranular dissolved pores and fractures. Hydrodynamic
conditions generally control distribution of these reservoirs, as limestone grains filled intergranularly with
sparry calcite cement are usually formed under strong hydrodynamic conditions. Sparry calcite cemented
limestone is subject to late dissolution with abundant soluble substances, which is one of the direct causes
for the well developed secondary dissolved pores. Oolitic bank and bioclastic bank are under high-energy
hydrodynamic conditions with the best reservoir petrophysical properties. Rims of beach bars are usually
in an intermittently-turbulent highly-hydrodynamic environment with medium reservoir petrophysical
properties. Lake bays and supratidal zones are under low-energy tranquil hydrodynamic conditions, with
poor reservoir petrophysical properties. During late diagenesis, large quantities of organic acid and slightly
acidic water were released from surrounding shale and migrated along the top unconformity of the 3rd
member of the Shahejie Formation, resulting in development of numerous secondary dissolved pores in
carbonate reservoirs, which is the main cause of high-quality reservoir formation in the sag. Additionally,
early charge of hydrocarbons restrained occurrence of authigenic minerals and metasomatism of calcite,
and thus promoted excellent preservation of dissolved pores.

1 Introduction
Lacustrine carbonate rocks are previously thought to have a short
deposition period in geological history and are associated with

unstable distribution in confined areas and are rarely well developed
in strata. As compared to marine carbonate rocks, lacustrine
carbonate rocks have barely received any attention. Increasingly indepth and meticulous research on oil and gas resources has shown
that continental lacustrine stratigraphic sequences were widely

of major controlling factors of high-quality carbonate reservoirs
based on core, thin section, drilling, and testing data in combination
with previous research findings. Finally, a depositional model is
proposed for lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the gentle slope
(ramp) area of northern Qikou Sag.

developed in China and lacustrine carbonate rocks are widely
distributed and have become excellent exploitation prospects.
Extensive studies in this field have made substantial progresses
(Xia et al., 2003; Liao et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). Williamson
et al (1980) established a sedimentary facies model for lacustrine
carbonate rocks within the Green River Formation of Uintah Basin,
the United States. Swirydezuk (1980) constructed a wave-built
oolitic lacustrine terrace facies as a complex of a few approximately
12-m-thick individual terraces. Bohacs et al (2000) elaborated type
of lakes and associated source rock potential and characteristics
with respect to sequence stratigraphy and geochemistry. Guan
(1985) summarized three types of depositional models for lacustrine
carbonate rocks in the middle Paleogene Guanzhuang Formation,
Pingyi Basin (Shandong, China), i.e., endogenous - exogenous
mixed deposition type, algal bank type, and shallow-water
evaporitic platform type. Wang et al (1993) systematically described
the distribution of lacustrine carbonate rocks in China. Wu et al (Wu
et al., 2003) proposed that the Paleogene lacustrine carbonate rocks
in the Qaidam Basin are mainly fractured reservoir. For the present
study area, Jin et al (2002) investigated the types of Paleogene
carbonate sedimentary facies in the Huanghua Depression. Pu et
al (2011) described geological characteristics of carbonate rocks
on the southwestern margin of the Qikou Sag. However, carbonate
rocks in the above mentioned areas feature thin single layers, high
heterogeneity, and substantially inconsistent reservoir properties.
Descriptions on the accumulation characteristics of these highquality carbonate reservoirs are quite general and major controlling
factors for the reservoir development still remain controversial.
Therefore, this study focus on a high-yield area, and carry out a
detailed description of reservoir characteristics and a assessment

The study area is located in the gentle slope area of the Qikou
Sag, which extends northward to Gangxi High, southward to
Chengning Uplift, and eastward to the Qikou main sag zone,
covering an area of 1500 km2 (Fig. 1). The study area consists
mainly of following tectonic units: the Qibei Ramp, Qinan Ramp,
and Chengbei Fault-ramp; its development involved five stages,
including an initial faulting - subsidence, rapid subsidence,
stable development, attenuation and depression. The study area
had experienced the weak - strong - weak faulting progress,
partitioned into unified sag, and small-big-small change of water
area. During the stable fault - subsidence stage of the 1st member
of the Shahejie Formation, the lake basin initially formed a flat
terrain. The sag gradually changed from an asymmetric dustpanlike shape to a symmetrical shape and reached its maximum size.
With insufficient detrital sediment supply, lacustrine carbonate
rocks were subsequently developed in the lake basin. The study
area is one of the main areas for lacustrine carbonate deposition
in the Bohai Bay Basin (Wang et al., 1999).

3 Reservoir characteristics
3.1 Lithological assemblages
Lithologically, the lower 1st member of Shahejie Formation
mainly consists of clastic and carbonate rocks. The carbonate
rock includes limestone and dolomite, the dolomite with well
developed bioclastic sparite, oolitic sparite, and fracture is the
major oil-bearing formation. Bioclastic limestone, including
sparite (Fig. 3a) and micrite, is formed by accumulation of
bioclastic components such as biogenic shells and bones; the
bioclastic content of bioclastic limestone is >50%, and the major
bioclastic component is gastropod fossil. Core observation
shows presence of a large number of complete snail fossils with
diameter of 1–5 mm (average 3 mm) and occasionally up to
1 cm; the snail fossils are easy to fall off; pits on the surface
of cores are visible. In oolitic limestone, there are mainly
superficial ooliths of small sizes (<0.5 mm); occasionally, the
real ooliths are observed with less concentric circles, generally
1–2 laps in round, oval, and irregular shapes; the core of
oolith is bioclast or terrigenous clast as dominated by quartz,
mainly oolitic sparite (Fig. 3b). Micritic limestone is mainly
composed of grayish white-grayish brown micritic calcite with
particle content <10% that commonly forms micro-horizontal
bedding with organic-rich mudstone (Fig. 3c). The rock turns to
argillaceous limestone with relatively high argillaceous content
of the clast (Fig. 3d). Dolomicrite is mainly composed of grayor grayish brown-colored micritic dolomite as dominated by a
xenomorphic texture with less hypidiomorphic texture (Figs.
3e, f). The dolomicrite formation, with a monolayer thickness of
1–5 cm, often forms thin interbeds with mudstone and co-occurs

smaller natural gamma (GR) value than sand-mudstone;
micritic limestone and dolomicrite have the smallest GR
values while shale has the largest GR value; the GR values
of marlstone and argillaceous dolomite are in between and
increase with argillaceous content. Relative to the tight micritic

3.2 Types of reservoir pore space
The pore spaces of carbonate reservoirs in the study area mainly
are the secondary pore and fracture; the latter includes tectonic
fractures and diagenetic fractures with less primary pores.
3.2.1 Primary pore
The primary pore of carbonate reservoirs are intergranular
pore, biological cavity pore, and intercrystalline pore. Due to
dolomitization, the porous grains shrink to a certain degree,
leading to formation of certain intercrystalline pores and usually
an increase in the rock porosity by 12–13%.
3.2.2 Secondary pore
The secondary pore of carbonate reservoirs are intergranular
dissolved pore, intragranular dissolved pore, mold pore, and
matrix dissolved pore. Of these, intergranular dissolved pore is
most well developed, followed by intragranular dissolved pore
and moldic pore.
Intergranular pore refers to secondary pore formed by dissolution
of intergranular matrix or cement, or dissolution enlargement of
primary intergranular pore. Under microscope, embayed, curved
cement is commonly observed (Figs. 4a, b). Intragranular dissolved
pore is resulted from partial intragranular dissolution, including

intra-ollith and intra-shell dissolved pores (Fig. 4c). Development
of intragranular dissolve pore is related to granular type, and the
intragranular dissolve pore can connect to intergranular dissolve
pore to form connected reservoir space. Moldic pore is mainly
formed by dissolution of bioclast and biogenic shell, showing
similar morphology and size as the granules (Fig. 4d). Matrix
dissolved pore is formed by partial dissolution of the intergranular
matrix, which commonly occurs in micritic granular limestone
with poor development and uneven distribution.
3.2.3 Fracture
In dolomite reservoirs, dolomite features thin single layer, high
brittleness, and multiple layers. Together with shale as the upper and
lower surrounding rock, this type of reservoirs (dolomite) has welldeveloped fracture, mainly tectonic fractures with less diagenetic
fractures. Dolomite formation is mainly distributed in mudstone
and primarily forms tiny fractures in thin-bedded dolomite rather
than high-angle fractures in thick-bedded dolomite.
Tectonic fracture is formed under the tectonic stress that
exceeds strength of the rock and thus leads to break of the rock.
The fractures have flat straight edge, long extension, clustering
occurrence, and certain direction; they are usually developed at
the top and axial parts of anticline structure as well as places of
near faults and fault disappearances; vertically, the fractures are
near-equal interval, parallel micro-fractures with fracture width
<1 mm (Figs. 4e, f). Statistics of the number of fractures show
that tectonic fractures are most developed in dolomite, followed
by limestone, and marlstone the least.
Diagenetic fractures are formed by compression, dehydration,
and shrinkage of sediments during diagenesis. This type of

fractures generally features short extension, lack of certain
direction, curved fracture surface, irregular shape, and late
dissolution widening. Diagenetic fractures not only serves
as good channel of oil and gas migration, but also improves
reservoir permeability and can be used as reservoir space.

are mainly developed in tectonically gentle areas with welldeveloped grainstone.
(2) Pore-fracture type refers to that pores serve as the main
reservoir space, and fractures are the main seepage channel.
Large fractures have accumulation capacity as well. Thus, the
pore-fracture type of the reservoir has better property than the
pore type of the reservoir. For example, dolorudite with small
porosity is associated with high permeability as well, suggesting
that fractures play a role as seepage channel (Fig. 5b).

3.2.4 Assemblage types of reservoir space
In the study area, bioclastic limestone reservoirs are mainly of
pore type and pore-fracture type, whereas dolomite reservoirs
are mainly of fracture type.

(3) Fracture type refers to that both reservoir space and seepage
channel are fractures. This kind of reservoirs, which are
mainly dolomite reservoir, have poor accumulation capacity
but high permeability. In the study area, core and thin section
observations of dolomicrite demonstrate that multiple fractures

(1) Pore type refers to that pores serve as reservoir space and
seepage channel. This type of reservoirs has large pores with
high porosity and permeability; correlation between porosity
and permeability is positive (Fig. 5a), reflecting direct influence
of porosity on permeability of reservoir. Pore-type reservoirs

for evaluating physical properties of reservoir. The porosity
and permeability of carbonate reservoirs in the Qikou Sag
are analyzed by statistics of petrophysical data (Fig. 7). The
porosity mainly ranges from 10% to 25% (for 68% of the
total samples) with an average value of 17.3%. The reservoir
permeability is low with an average permeability value of
55.4 mD. Approximately 60% of the total samples have
permeability values of less than 1 mD;19.2% of the samples
have permeability values of 1–10 mD; 11.4% of the samples have
permeability values of 10–100 mD; and 9.6% of the samples
have permeability values of 100–1000 mD.

3.3 Pore structure
Pore structure refers to throat size, distribution, and connectivity
of pores in reservoir rocks, and is one of the key indicators
for reservoir permeability. The pore structure of reservoirs
in the Qikou Sag can be divided into two types: the first type
of bioclastic limestone reservoirs has medium-coarse skewed
intrusive mercury curve, good sorting, and medium porosityhigh permeability (Fig. 6a); the second type of bioclastic
limestone reservoirs has medium-fine skewed intrusive mercury
curve, good sorting, and low porosity-low permeability, with
good pore-throat sorting (Fig. 6b). The first type of bioclastic
limestone reservoirs is predominant in the study area.

The porosity and permeability of reservoirs show substantial
variations, reflecting lithologies of different carbonate rocks.
Statistics of porosity and permeability data show that porosity
of different types of carbonate reservoirs gradually increases
from micritic limestone to bioclastic limestone (Fig. 8a). Oolitic
limestone and bioclastic limestone form medium-high porosity

forms low porosity reservoirs. Of four types of carbonate
rocks, bioclastic limestone has the highest permeability with an
average of 60.67 mD, followed by oolitic limestone (Fig. 8b).

and cementation.

4.2 Cementation

4.1 Compaction

Cementation occurs mainly in grain-limestones such as bioclastic
limestone and oolitic limestone in the oil groups Bin-I and Ban4, leading to formation of 3 generations of cements. The first
generation is mainly dark needle-like microcrystalline calcite
formed soon after sediment deposition, which is susceptible to late
transformation and uneasy to be identified in morphology. The
second generation consists of ctenoid and rim calcite grains that
are distributed at grain boundaries; calcite, mostly hypidiomorphic,
bright and clean, is formed in a hyporheic-mixed water diagenetic
environment and reflects influence of atmospheric freshwater. The

In the early diagenetic stage of carbonate rocks, the compaction is
responsible for tight arrangement of grains, further compressing
intergranular interstitial materials and reducing pores in size
(Fig. 9a). This process is associated with superficial tearing and
crumpling and internal structural deformation of grains, as well
as breakdown of organic matter into irregular veinlets. Despite
its destructing effect on the primary pores of reservoirs, the
compaction is generally weak due to fast cementation.

third generation consists of grainy mineral that are distributed
in between pores with good crystal form, automorphic texture,
transparent and clean structure; the mineral is mainly formed
in an atmospheric-freshwater diagenetic environment (Fig. 9b).
Cementation has a double-sided effect, that is, this process destructs
pores as well as reduces impact of compaction.

4.3 Metasomatism
Metasomatism mainly occurs as replacement of calcite, anhydrite,
and other minerals by dolomite, i.e., dolomitization (Fig. 9c).
During replacement of calcite by dolomite, dissolution is greater
than precipitation, resulting in formation of dissolution pores.
Additionally, enlargement of crystal grains leads to increase in
the intercrystalline pore diameter. All above changes contribute to
increases in the porosity and permeability of dolomitized limestone,
thereby improving rock’s physical properties.

4.4 Dissolution
When property of pore water contained in carbonate rock
formations changes, carbonate minerals or other components
will undergo dissolution (Fig. 9d). In the early diagenetic stage,
dissolution is selective, for example, to dissolve oolith and part
of oolitic core but not the other part of oolitic limestone, leading
to formation of dissolved moldic pore of oolith. During the
late diagenetic stage, because the unstable Mg-rich calcite has
transferred to Mg-poor calcite, so non-selective dissolution is
very common, and thus results in formation of dissolved pore,
dissolved fracture, and dissolved karren.

4.5 Recrystallization
Recrystallization generally occurs in two pathways (Deng et al.,
1990; Meng et al., 2010; Jin et al., 2011): (1) calcite recrystallizes
after dissolution to form large crystal minerals (Fig. 9e); and
(2) dolomicrite recrystallizes to form powder crystal dolomites
(Fig. 9f). These rocks share the same mineral components but
differ in size, shape, and orientation of mineral crystals. The
recrystallization process changes tight fine-texture rocks to those
with coarse, loose structure and more intergranular pores, thus
is conducive to groundwater percolating and provid favorable

conditions for development and occurrence of dissolved pores.

The widespread bioclastic bank, oolitic bank, and migration of
large amounts of organic acids and slightly acidic water from shale
during the late diagenetic stage along the top unconformity of the
3rd member of the Shahejie Formation, promot development of
substantial secondary dissolved pores in carbonate reservoirs. This
is the major factor that controls formation of high-quality reservoirs
in the study area. Additionally, early hydrocarbon charging
suppressed authigenic mineral formation and calcite metasomatism,
thereby preserving dissolved pore structure.

5.1 Sedimentary microfacies and rock types
The widespread bioclastic bank and oolitic bank is the major
controlling factors of high-quality reservoir formations in the
study area. The sedimentary micro-facies mainly control rock
types. Spaces between limestone grains formed under strong
hydrodynamic conditions, is mainly filled with sparry calcite
cement which easy to dissolve in the late dissolution process. The
above process is a direct cause of development of secondary pores.
The oolitic ban k and bioclastic ban k developed in the
continuously unrest high-energy hydrodynamic conditions,
lithologically, both mainly consist of bioclastic sparite and
oolitic sparite, and have good physical properties characterized
by high porosity (>20%) and high permeability (>10 mD). The
bank-bar edge formed in the intermittent turbulent high-energy
hydrodynamic conditions; lithologically, it mainly consists of
marl bioclastic limestone, marl oolitic limestone, and oolitic
dolomite, and the intergranular spaces are filled with marls; the
porosity is 12–20% and the permeability is 1–10 mD, suggesting
medium physical properties of reservoirs. Lake bay and
supratidal zones developed in the low-energy hhydrodynamic
condition, lithologically, both consist of micritic limestone,
micritic dolomite, dolomitic limestone, and dolomite, and have
poor physical properties, characterized by low porosity of
2–12% and low permeability <1.0 mD (Table 2).

5.3 Fracture development

Layer

Large-scale dissolution promotes formation of high-quality
reservoir. Carbonate bank bodies of the lower 1st member of
Shahejie Formation were directly overlain on the 3rd member of
Shahejie Formation. Huge thick argillaceous source rocks of the
2nd member of the Shahejie Formation and the 3rd member of
Shahejie Formation in the central sag area entered the medium
maturity stage during deposition of the 1st member of Shahejie
Formation and oil generation peak stage during late deposition
of Dongying Formation. During thermal evolution, large
amounts of organic acids and slightly acidic gases were released
via organic matter decomposition, resulting in acidification of

formation water and its migration along unconformity. These
processes promoted large-scale non-selective dissolution of
carbonate bank bodies above the unconformity associated with
formation of numerous secondary pores, thus greatly improving
physical properties of reservoirs. Therefore, diagenesis is one
of the major factors that control formation of high-quality
reservoirs in the study area (Fig. 10).

5.2 Diagenesis

Fig. 10 Reservoir formation model of lacustrine carbonate rocks in the gentle slope area of Qikou Sag

system. The dolomite formations feature thin single layer,
multiple layers, and high brittleness. Together the upper and
lower surrounding rocks (shale) allow well development of
fractures. Due to effect of brittleness, fractures are developed
most commonly in dolomite, followed by limestone, and
marlstone. Pure coarse carbonate rocks such as sparite biolithite
and oolitic limestone have great brittleness as well, in which
fractures are easily developed. In Qikou Sag, there exist a
number of low-angle faults, near which fractures are more
developed (Dai et al., 1998; Pan et al., 2004; Zhang et al.,
2005; Zhou et al., 2011). Therefore, fracture is one of the major
structures that control the formation of high-quality dolomite
reservoirs in the study area.

5.4 Impact of early hydrocarbon filling
During deposition of the 1st member of Shahejie Formation,
huge thick mudstone formations of the 3rd and 2nd members of
Shahejie Formation entered the medium maturity stage, and oil
and gas from source rocks preferentially entered into carbonate
reservoirs of the lower 1st member of Shahejie Formation.
Oil and gas charge dispelled pore water and changed original
water-lithofacies balance and chemical composition of pore
fluids. These processes resulted in reduction of inorganic ion
concentrations and impeded energy transfer between mineral
and ions, further inhibiting formation of authigenic minerals
and calcite metasomatism and thus preserving dissolved pore

structures.

6 Conclusions
(1) High-quality carbonate reservoirs of the lower 1st member
of Shahejie Formation mainly consist of bioclastic limestone
and oolitic limestone. The reservoir storage space mainly
includes secondary intergranular dissolved pores and fractures.
The assemblages of storage space in the carbonate reservoirs
are dominated by pore type and pore-fracture type. Tectonic
fractures are developed in the dolomite reservoirs and serve as
the good storage space as well as seepage channel.
(2) Hydrodynamic conditions control quality and distribution
of reservoirs. The intergranular interstitial materials of the
limestone grains which formed under strong hydrodynamic
conditions are the sparry calcite cements. These cements can be
easily dissolved during the late dissolution, which is one of the
direct causes for secondary pore development. Oolitic banks and
bioclastic banks which formed in the strongest hydrodynamic
conditions and have the best reservoir petrophysical properties.
Bank-bar edge which formed under intermittently turbulent
high-energy hydrodynamic conditions have medium reservoir
petrophysical properties. Lake bay and supratidal zone which
formed under low-energy tranquil hydrodynamic conditions
generally have poor reservoir properties.
(3) During the thermal evolution, huge thick organic-rich shale

formation of the 3rd and 2nd members of Shahejie Formation,
released large amounts of organic acids and acidic water which
migrated along the top unconformity of the 3rd member of
Shahejie Formation, thus forming numerous secondary dissolved
pores in the carbonate reservoirs. This is considered to be one
of the major factors responsible for the development of highquality reservoirs. Additionally, early charge of hydrocarbons
inhibited formation of authigenic mineral and metasomatism of
calcite, thereby preserving dissolved pore structure.
