Abstract: The Sinian-Cambrian formations of the Sichuan Basin have favorable hydrocarbon
accumulation conditions, but the exploration for large-scale gas fields is quite challenging due to old
strata and multiple tectonic movements. Since the Weiyuan Sinian large gas field was found in 1964,
the largest monoblock gas field (Anyue Gasfield) was discovered in the Cambrian Longwangmiao
Formation of the Moxi region in 2013 with proven gas reserves of 440.1×109 m3. Total proven,
probable and possible reserves exceed one trillion cubic meters in the Sinian Dengying Formation and
the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation of the Gaoshiti-Moxi region. The natural gas components,
light hydrocarbons, reservoir bitumen abundance and other evidences prove that the dry natural
gas was mainly derived from oil-cracking, with methane (a content of 82.65%-97.35%), ethane (a
content of 0.01%-0.29%), nitrogen (a content of 0.44%-6.13%), helium (a content of 0.01%-0.06%),
and hydrogen sulphide (0.62-61.11 g/m3). Gas reservoir pressure increases gradually from the Sinian
normal pressure (a pressure coefficient of 1.07-1.13) to high pressure (a pressure coefficient of 1.531.70) in the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation. The temperature of the gas reservoir is 137.5163 oC. Gas reservoir traps are divided into three categories: tectonic type, tectonic-formation type
and tectonic-lithologic type. The large-scale enrichment of the Sinian-Cambrian natural gas results
from effective configuration of the large stable inherited palaeo-uplift during the Tongwan tectonic
movement, wide distribution of ancient source rocks, high-quality reservoirs with vast pore-cavity,
crude oil cracking of large palaeo-reservoirs and favorable preservation conditions. According to the
palaeo-structure pattern prior to crude oil cracking of the palaeo-reservoirs, and bitumen abundance
as well as the distribution characteristics of current gas reservoirs, the accumulation patterns of the
cracking gas reservoir can be classified into three types: accumulation type, semi-accumulation and
semi-dispersion type, and dispersion type. This understanding will play an important role in guiding
the exploration of the Sinian-Cambrian natural gas exploration in the Sichuan Basin.

1 Introduction

exceeded trillion of cubic meters (Du et al., 2014). Therefore, a
review of research achievements regarding characteristics and
natural gas accumulation patterns of large gas reservoirs can
enrich theory of natural gas accumulation of ancient carbonates
and improve understanding accumulation formation rules
of large and super large natural gas reservoirs, and have an
important guiding significance to deployment decision-making
of future exploration and expansion of new field exploration.

Sinian-Cambrian strata in the Sichuan Basin have been explored
for more than 50 years (Song, 1987; Du, 1996; Zhang and
Zhang, 2002; Ran, 2006). In 1964, Weiyuan Gasfield as a large
Sinian gas field was discovered in the Sichuan Basin. At that
time Sinian strata were drilled successively in the Longnvsi
structure, the Anpingdian structure, the Ziyang palaeo-trap, the
Gaoshiti structure and so on, and commercial gas flow or lowproduction gas flow were obtained, while Sinian exploratory

In the Anyue Gasfield, the gas reservoirs of the Dengying
Formation and Longwangmiao Formation are generally characterized by small thickness per layer (averaging 1.20-3.66 m) and
large accumulated thickness (averaging 24.4-39.50 m), dominated by low porosity (averaging 3.22%-4.28%) and low permeability (averaging 0.593-1.160 mD) with local development of highporosity high-permeability members (Table 1). The Cambrian
Longwangmiao Formation is dominated by doloarenite, relict
doloarenite, and fine- meso crystalline dolomite; while the Sinian Dengying Formation is dominated by algal boundstone doloarenite, algal doloarenite, cryptomonad thrombolite dolomite,
algal stromatolite dolomite, algal framestone and doloarenite (Xu
et al., 2014). Reservoiring spaces primarily consist of various
secondary dissolution pores (including interparticle dissolution
pores, intraparticle dissolution pores, intercrystalline dissolution
pores and relict interparticle pores) and cavities (Fig. 3). The
karstification is the major diagenesis to control reservoir development (Yang et al., 2014), and all kinds of fractures (including
structural fractures, dissolution fractures and seam sutures) are
also more developed (Yang et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2014), playing
an important role in improvement of reservoir permeability and

Silurian. In the region, three suites of hydrocarbon accumulation
assemblages are developed (Fig. 2). Moreover, gas reservoirs of
Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation, Member 4 and Member
2 of Dengying Formation were found in the Sinian-Ordovician
hydrocarbon accumulation assemblages. Gas reservoirs of
Member 1 of Middle Triassic Leikoupo Formation and Member
2 of Lower Triassic Jialingjiang Formation were discovered
in the Permian-Middle Triassic hydrocarbon accumulation
assemblages. Gas reservoirs of Member 6, Member 4 and
Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation were found in the Xujiahe
Formation-Jurassic hydrocarbon accumulation assemblages.
Among them, the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation belongs
to the gentle-slope-type carbonate platform deposits as a
whole, and grain shoal facies is the most favorable facies for
development of high-quality reservoirs; the Dengying Formation
belongs to the rimmed-type carbonate platform deposits, mainly
including platform margin facies, intraplatform mound-shoal
facies, intermound-intershoal marine facies and evaporitic
platform facies, where the microbial-framework dolomite,
thrombolite-framework dolomite, grain dolomite, laminite
dolomite and stromatolite dolomite are the most favorable
reservoir rock (Zou et al., 2014).

2.3 Trap characteristics and gas reservoir types
Tectonic framework of the Anyue Gasfield (Longwangmiao
Formation-Dengying Formation) is characterized by large NEEtrending nose-like uplift which plunging from W to NE，and
is shown as multi-row and multi-high composite structure. At
present, many gas reservoirs have been discovered, including
the Longwangmiao Formation, Member 4 and Member 2 of
the Dengying Formation. The trap characteristics of different
members of gas reservoirs (Table 2) are different from gas
reservoir types.
In the Gaoshiti-Moxi region, there are mainly developed two

structural traps on the top of the Longwangmiao Formation, the
south is the Gaoshiti structural trap and the north is the Moxi
structural trap. Trap elements are listed in Table 2. Overall,
the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation are characterized
by higher topography in the west and lower topography in the
east, relatively gentle relief in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region and
monoclines in other regions. At present, water production
mainly occurs in the monocline areas where altitude deeper than
-4500 m and shallower than -4200 m; gas production mainly
exists in the more gentle areas where altitude from -4500m to
-4200 m, however, strata of water production exists from Well
MX 47 to Well MX 204 at a altitude more than -4385 m, while
strata from Well MX 11 and Well MX 23 at a altitude shallower
than -4471 m are all gas-bearing beds; moreover, in Well BL
1, sand bodies in top contain gas while sand bodies in the low
part contain water. Therefore, gas and water distribution of
gas reservoirs in the Longwangmiao Formation is controlled
by sand bodies and local structures with complex gas-water
contact, mainly belonging to tectonic-lithologic gas reservoir
(Fig. 4a and Fig.4b).
In the Gaoshiti-Moxi region, the Sinian top structure shows that
the Gaoshiti buried structure, the Moxi buried structure and the
Moxi No.1 fault can constitute a unified trap with the lowest trap
line of -4940 m and trap area of 1977 km2. In the Gaoshiti-Moxi
region, Member 4 of the Dengying Formation at topographic
high are identified as gas layers through logging interpretation.
In Well NJJ of the Longnvsi structure, daily gas production of
Member 4 of the Dengying Formation is 18.5×103 m3. According
to the logging interpretation, in the northern Moxi region, the
upper submember of Member 4 of Dengying Formation in
Well MX 22 is identified as gas-bearing layers, while the lower
submember of Member 4 has a gas-water contact at a altitude
of -5243 m, nearly 200 m lower than bottom boundary of gas-

in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region is the development area of a vast
composite structure-formation gas reservoir (Fig. 4c).
Both Moxi and Gaoshiti buried structures form traps separately
on the top boundary of Member 2 of the Dengying Formation.

G.Wei et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 2,164-177

Gas reservoirs in Member 2 of Gaoshiti-Moxi region are
controlled by structural traps, where the upper part of Member
2 is gas–bearing reservoirs and the lower part is commonly
water–bearing reservoirs. Moxi block and Gaoshiti block have
uniform gas-water contacts at altitudes of -5167.5 m and -5159.2
m respectively, belonging to tectonic trap gas reservoir with
bottom water (Fig. 4d).

2.4 Fluid properties
In the Anyue Gasfield, the main fluids of Sinian and Cambrian
gas reservoirs include natural gas and formation water.
2.4.1 Natural gas
Natural gas compositions are dominated by hydrocarbon gas
as a whole, composed of methane with a content of 82.65%97.35%, ethane with a content of 0.01%- 0.29% (0.12%0.29% in the Longwangmiao Formation, and 0.01%-0.05%
in the Dengying Formation) and trace amounts of propane
occasionally. The natural gas dry coefficient is 0.9976-0.9999,
indicating a typical dry gas. Non-hydrocarbon gases mainly
include N2 (a content of 0.44%-6.13%), CO2 (a content of 0.10%14.16%), H2S (a content of 0.62-61.11 g/m3) and He (a content of
0.01%-0.06%). According to gas reservoir classification standard
(NEA, 2009), it belongs to the gas reservoir with a mediumlow content of H2S. As age of the reservoir become old, the H2S
content increases, i.e., 0.62-61.11 g/m 3 in the Longwangmiao
Formation with an average of 11.23 g/m 3, 6.27-32.06 g/m 3 in
Member 4 of Dengying Formation with an average of 17.04 g/
m3, and 6.04-45.70 g/m3 in Member 2 of Dengying Formation
with an average of 19.50 g/m3.
2.4.2 Formation water
Formation water production exists in gas reservoirs of the
Longwangmiao For mation and Member 2 of Dengying
Formation. In the Longwangmiao Formation of Well MX 203
and Well MX 204, total salinities of formation water are 109.83135.68 g/L and pH values are 6.49-7.47, indicating calcium
chloride type water. In Member 2 of Dengying Formation, total
salinities of formation water are 57-130 g/L, indicating calcium
chloride type water.

2.5 Temperature-pressure system
2.5.1 Transition from Sinian normal pressure gas reservoir
to Cambrian high pressure gas reservoir
In the middle part of Member 2 of the Dengying Formation of
Gaoshiti block, the formation pressures are 57.56-57.66 MPa
with a pressure coefficient of 1.07-1.08 in the single-well gas
reservoir; in the middle part of the single-well gas reservoir in
Moxi block, the formation pressures are 58.62-59.08 MPa with
a pressure coefficient of 1.07–1.10. Both gas reservoirs belong

to the normal pressure gas reservoir. Member 4 of Dengying
Formation is further divided into the upper submember and
lower submember. In the middle part of of the upper submember
of Member 4 in the Gaoshiti block, the formation pressures are
56.57-56.63 MPa with a pressure coefficient of 1.12-1.13; in the
middle part in Moxi block, the formation pressure is 56.80 MPa
with a pressure coefficient of 1.10. In the lower submenber of
Member 4 of Well GS 6, the formation pressure is 56.84 MPa
with a pressure coefficient of 1.10. Both the upper and lower
submembers of Member 4 in the Gaoshiti-Moxi block have very
similar pressure coefficients, suggesting that these belong to
the same pressure system. The Longwangmiao Formation in
Moxi block has a formation pressure of 75.81-76.37 MPa and a
pressure coefficient of 1.56–1.70, belonging to the high pressure
gas reservoir according to the gas reservoir classification
standard (NEA, 2009); the Longwangmiao Formation in the
Gaoshiti block has a formation pressure of 68.27 MPa and a
pressure coefficient of 1.53, also belonging to high pressure
gas reservoir as well; these two blocks are in different pressure
systems.
2.5.2 A high temperature gas reservoir of Sinian-Cambrian
gas reservoir
In the Sinian and Cambrian gas reservoirs of the Anyue
Gasfield, a geothermal gradient is generally about 2.5-2.7 ℃/
hundred meter, and temperatures of the central gas reservoir is
137.50-163.28℃, indicating a high temperature gas reservoir.
It is slightly different in different blocks and horizons, e.g.,
temperatures of gas reservoirs in Member 2 of Dengying
Formation in the Moxi block are 155.82-159.91℃, and that in
the Gaoshiti block are 156.71-156.71o C; temperatures of gas
reservoirs in the upper submember of Member 4 of Dengying
Formation in the Gaoshiti block are 150.2-161.0℃, and that in
the Moxi block are 149.6-158.5℃; temperatures of gas reservoirs
in the lower submember of Member 4 in the Gaoshiti block are
155.1-160.3℃, and that in the Longwangmiao Formation are
137.5-143.9 ℃.

3 G eolog ic cond it ions of large gas
reservoir formation
Massive enrichment of natural gas is caused by effective
configuration of large stable inherited palaeo-uplift in the
Tongwan phase, widespread distribution of ancient source rocks,
large-area high-quality pore-vug reservoirs, oil cracking of large
palaeo-oil reservoirs and good preservation conditions.

3.1 Large palaeo-uplift and constant steady
evolution in Tongwan movement
Since the Weiyuan Gasfield was discovered in the Sichuan
Basin, many scholars have carried out systematic studies on the
formation and evolution of the Leshan–Longnvsi palaeo-uplift

as well as controlling effects on hydrocarbon accumulation
successively (Song, 1987; Xu et al., 2002; Yang, 2002; Wei
et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012;
Wei et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2014; Mei et al.,
2014). It is believed that the Leshan-Longnvsi palaeo-uplift
is a long-term inherited palaeo-uplift, which had a prototype
in the Tongwan phase, formed in the Caledonian period and
experienced multiphase synsedimentary uplift and denudation
with certain inheritance and significant controlling effect on
regional hydrocarbon distribution. The latest research indicates
that three episodes of the Late Sinian-Early Cambrian tectonic
movements occurred in the Sichuan Basin, referred to as the
Episode-I of Tongwan movement (the late depositional period
of Member 2 of Dengying Formation), the Episode-Ⅱ of
Tongwan movement (the late depositional period of Member
4 of Dengying Formation) and the Episode-Ⅲ of Tongwan
movement (the late depositional period of Maidiping Formation),
respectively. The layer flattening and balance profile technology
were used for tectonic evolution analysis on 25 large seismic
profiles in the Sichuan Basin and adjacent survey line of 27×103
km. Results show that Tongwanian tectogenesis led to two giant
palaeo-uplifts in Gaoshiti-Moxi and Weiyuan-Ziyang. Prior to
the sedimentation of the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation, a
tectonic pattern was shown as “two uplifts and one depression”
on the Sinian top (Fig. 5a), i.e., two uplifts were separated by
a depression, that called Gaoshiti-Moxi palaeo-uplift and the
Weiyuan-Ziyang palaeo-uplift respectively. Before Ordovician,
these two independent palaeo-uplifts were still developed on
the Sinian top, the cores of Gaoshiti-Moxi and Weiyuan-Ziyang
palaeo-uplifts had areas of about 22×103 km 2 and 19×103 km 2
respectively. Before Permian, the Sinian top evolved into a large
palaeo-uplift (equivalent to the Leshan-Longnvsi palaeo-uplift)
with two highs (Fig. 5b). Later, tectonic highs of the WeiyuanZiyang palaeo-uplift migrated from the early Ziyang area to the
Weiyuan area, while those of the Gaoshiti-Moxi palaeo-uplift
were basically unchanged and exhibited inherited development
( Wei et al., 2013). Therefore, the Tongwanian palaeogeomorphic pattern fundamentally controlled development
of source rocks and reservoirs, formation of a large-scale
palaeo-oil reservoir and its late cracking and accumulation; the
Gaoshiti-Moxi palaeo-uplift especially has maintained longterm inherited development since the Tongwan phase, providing
the most favorable places for formation of giant gas fields. The
Leshan-Longnvsi Caledonian palaeo-uplift has only played a
role in modifying formation and distribution of the Tongwanian
palaeo-uplift and giant gas fields in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region
from Ordovician to nowadays.

3.2 Four suites of large-area ancient source rocks
Previously it was generally believed that the Sinian natural
gas in the Sichuan Basin originated from “backf low” of

170

Cambrian source rocks (Huang et al., 1993; Xu et al., 2000;
Dai, 2003), and mainly accumulated in the weathered crust
on the Sinian top. The authors studied distribution of Sinian
and Cambrian source rocks, especially the Lower Cambrian
source rocks in Qiongzhusi Formation, is very different from
the previous understanding, which has the maximum thickness
in the Tongwanian intra-cratonic rift (Fig. 6a). Meanwhile,
conventional geochemical, organic petrological, and inorganic
minor element methods for source rock evaluation were
employed to systematically evaluate effectiveness of SinianCambrian source rocks in the basin peripheral outcrops and
wells of basin interior. It was proposed that besides Lower
Cambrian shale in Qiongzhusi Formation as major source
rock (TOC content of 0.50%-8.49%, average 1.95%), highquality Sinian source rocks including Doushantuo mudstones,
Dengying mudstones as well as argillaceous carbonate, are
developed with TOC values of 0.50%-14.17%, 0.50%-4.73%
and 0.20%-3.67% respectively, and these are all in over-mature
stage. Four suites of source rocks are widely developed in the
basin with a superimposition area of about 0.42×106 km2 and gas
generation of 1938×1012 m3, providing an abundant gas source
for the formation of large gas fields. Discovery of Sinian source
rocks enables finding of Sinian gas reservoirs and expansion of
exploration.
According to hydrocarbon generation and evolution history
of source rocks, hydrocarbon generation of Sinian source
rocks in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region started during the MiddleLate Cambrian. However, due to influence of the Caledonian
movement, the strata uplifted, formation temperature decreased,
and hydrocarbon generation process of source rocks was ceased
(Fig. 6b), which continued before the Permian. In the Permian,
burial took place again, hydrocarbon generation continued, and
the region remained in liquid hydrocarbon generation stage
until the Late Triassic. Since the Late Triassic, with increase
of formation temperature, the generated liquid hydrocarbon
began to be cracked up until the Cretaceous. The hydrocarbon
generation process of Cambrian source rocks is basically the
same as that of the Sinian, except that period of hydrocarbon
generation and liquid hydrocarbon cracking slightly later than
Sinian, but liquid hydrocarbon cracking had already been
completed in the Cretaceous.

3.3 Large-area superimposed distribution three
suites of pore-vug type high-quality reservoirs
Development of Sinian-Cambrian sediments and high-quality
reservoirs in the Sichuan Basin are also controlled by the
palaeo-morphologic pattern in the Tongwan phase. Around the
intra-platform rift and palaeo-uplift, platform-margin facies
belts were developed in Member 2 of Dengying Formation. On
palaeo-uplifts，intra-platform shoal bodies were distributed in
different directions. In the south of the Gaoshiti-Moxi palaeo-

uplift, intra-platform shoals were dominated by NE-trending
distribution, while intra-platform shoals in the north were
dominated by SN-trending distribution. In the Weiyuan-Ziyang
palaeo-uplift, the intra-platform shoals were dominated by NWtrending distribution. The intra-platform shoals in Member 4 of
Dengying Formation basically inherited distribution pattern of
those in Member 4 of Dengying Formation. In the reservoirs of
the Dengying Formation, reservoiring spaces mainly consist of
secondary dissolution cavities, interparticle and intercrystalline
dissolution pores. High-quality reservoirs are mainly distributed
around the palaeo-uplifts on both sides of the intra-platform
rift. The areas of type I and type II reservoirs are 148×103 km2
in Member 2 of the Dengying Formation and 125×103 km 2 in
Member 4 of the Dengying Foramtion.

Development of grain shoals in the Cambrian Longwangmiao
Formation is also controlled by the palaeo-morphologic pattern
in the Tongwan movement. Shoal bodies were dominated
by NE-trending distribution, and multiple shoal bodies were
distributed of rows and belts from south to north. Shoal
bodies under different energy environment were developed in
different regions of palaeo-morphology. In the Gaoshiti-Moxi
palaeo-uplift, high-energy grain shoals were of dissolution
vugs, relatively coarse particles and large thickness per layer
of shoal body. In the Longwangmiao Formation, four-phase
aggradation-type grain shoals were developed as large-area
superimposed continuous distribution pattern. Each phase
of shoal body could be divided into shoal proper and shoal
margin, and two large grain-shoal propers were developed

on the plane of the Moxi region. The low-energy grain shoals
were developed in the intra-platform rift and were of pinhole
solution cavities, finer grains and smaller thickness per layer of
shoal body. In the reservoirs of the Longwangmiao Formation,
reservoiring spaces mainly consist of interparticle dissolution
pores, intercrystalline dissolution pores, and medium- and
small-sized dissolution cavities. The areas of type I and type II
reservoirs are 52.7×103 km 2.
Massive superimposition between favorable reservoir facies and
dissolution governs the large-area superimposed continuous
distribution of Sinian-Cambrian reservoirs (Xu et al., 2014),
providing effective reservoiring space for formation of large gas
fields.

3.4 Cracking of oil in large palaeo-reservoir or
dispersed liquid hydrocarbon
C1-C3 components, C6 -C7 components of light hydrocarbon and
C8-C12 compounds in natural gas as well as a large amount of
bitumen in reservoirs indicate that Sinian-Cambrian natural gas
in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region was mainly cracking gas from the
palaeo-reservoir crude oil or dispersed liquid hydrocarbon.
Since Prinzhofer and Huc proposed to use a lnC1/C2-lnC2/C3
chart to identify whether natural gas belongs to initial cracking
gas of kerogen or secondary cracking gas of crude oil (Prinzhofer
and Huc, 1995), this method has been widely applied in China
(Zhao et al., 2001; Xie et al., 2005). In the Gaoshiti-Moxi
region, ratios of C1/C2 of natural gas changed little, while ratios
of C 2 /C3 changed greatly, indicating the crude-oil cracking
gas. Analysis of light hydrocarbon of the dry gas (Hu et al.,
2005) was used to detect the light hydrocarbon components of
natural gas in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region successfully (Wei et
al., 2014), and it was found that C6 -C7 components of natural

gas presented higher contents of isoalkanes and cycloparaffins,
which also is the characteristic of crude-oil cracking gas. In
addition, in the natural gas from Member 2 and the lower part
of Member 4 of Dengying Formation in Well GS 1, the highabundance C8-C12 compounds were also detected, indicating the
intermediate product in the process of crude oil cracking into
gas. The more intuitive evidence of crude-oil cracking gas was
massive bitumen in the reservoirs of the Dengying Formation
and the Longwangmiao Formation. From the uplift high to
slope, bitumen abundance decreased gradually (Fig. 7). These
characteristics, mentioned above, indicate that the natural gas of
the Dengying Formation and the Longwangmiao Formation in
the Gaoshiti-Moxi region is mainly crude-oil cracking gas.

3.5 High-strength sealing abilities of three suites of
muddy shale/gypsum-salt caprock
Drilling results show that there are three suites of SinianCambrian reservoir-cap assemblages in the Gaoshiti-Moxi
region of the Sichuan Basin (Fig. 2), eg., (1) the assemblage
of the Sinian dolomite reservoir in Member 2 of Dengying
Formation-mudstone caprock in Member 3 of Dengying
Formation, (2) the assemblage of dolomite reservoir in Member
4 of Dengying Formation-Lower Cambrian muddy shale
caprock in the Qiongzhusi Formation (including the Maidiping
Formation), and (3) the assemblage of Lower Cambrian dolomite
reservoir in the Longwangmiao Formation- Middle Cambrian
sandy mudstone + the Upper Cambrian tight carbonate rocks
in the Xixiangchi Formation + Permian muddy shale + the
Middle and Lower Triassic gypsum-salt caprock. Among these,
the Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation and the Permian
are two suites of regional muddy shale caprocks; furthermore,
the Permian-Mid-Triassic is the ultrahigh pressure layer with
ultrahigh pressure closure. In addition, the regional Middle and

G.Wei et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 2,164-177

Lower Triassic gypsum-salt rocks in the Jialingjiang Formation
and the Leikoupo Formation also play a very important role
in preservation of the Sinian-Cambrian reservoirs. From the
Sinian to the Cambrian, the gas reservoir pressure coefficient
changed from normal pressure (pressure coefficient of 1.071.13) to ultrahigh pressure (pressure coefficient of 1.531.70). Overpressure formation of gas reservoir is related to
hydrocarbon generation of source rocks, crude oil cracking and
other factors (Liu et al., 2014). Hence, the present difference
in pressure between Sinian and Cambrian gas reservoirs was
related to gradual upward diffusion of natural gas, the Cambrian
gas reservoir being closer to the ultrahigh pressure gas reservoir
cap, less natural gas loss and better preservation of original gas
reservoir pressure.

4 Gas reservoir accumulation types and
favorable area prediction
4.1 Gas reservoir accumulation types
A variety of evidence has demonstrated that the SinianCambrian natural gas in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region is mainly the
crude-oil cracking gas, but is it the accumulation-type crudeoil cracking gas or dispersed organic-matter cracking gas? In
order to facilitate the lateral comparison and analysis, based
on abundance of solid bitumen in the present reservoirs and
distribution of present gas reservoirs, in combination with the
palaeo-tectonic pattern of the Sinian top and the Cambrian
Longwangmiao Formation bottom before substantial crude oil
cracking (before the Late Triassic), the Sinian-Cambrian gas
reservoir can be divided into three accumulation modes, eg.,
accumulation type, semi-accumulation and semi-dispersion
type, and dispersion type (Table 3); the lower limits of bitumen

content in accumulation-type and dispersion-type gas reservoirs
were 1.0% and 0.5% respectively.
4.1.1 Accumulation-type gas reservoir
According to tectonic evolution of ancient and present tectonic
positions of current gas reservoirs, this kind of gas reservoir is
further divided into two subtypes: inherited accumulation type
and adjusted accumulation type. The inherited accumulationtype gas reservoirs refer to the large palaeo-reservoirs always
located in inherited palaeo-uplift areas and formed at palaeouplift highs before the Late Triassic. After the Late Triassic,
the palaeo-reservoirs gradually began to crack, and after
finalization of the Himalayan structures, the original palaeoreservoir areas were still at tectonic highs. The accumulation
positions of current gas reservoirs are basically consistent with
those of palaeo-reservoirs (Fig. 8), where mainly accumulated
palaeo-reservoir cracking gas, but contributions of dispersed
liquid hydrocarbon cracking gas in a small number of slope
areas cannot be excluded. In the Gaoshiti-Moxi region, Sinian
and Cambrian gas reservoirs in the Longwangmiao Formation
are typical representatives. The bitumen content in this region
is higher, generally greater than 1.0% (Fig. 7), but with a large
span on the vertical distribution; in deep and shallow reservoirs,
bitumen abundances are almost equivalent, e.g., in Gaoshiti
region, bitumen contents are 0.2%–3.4% in Member 4 of
Dengying Formation at depth of 4956-5208 m, 0.1%-3.2% in
Member 2 of Dengying Formation at depth of 5266-5400 m, and
0.1%-3.8% in the Longwangmiao Formation at depth of 44904735 m. In the Moxi region, bitumen contents are 0.2%-4.0%
in Member 4 of Dengying Formation at depth of 5015-5215 m,
0.1%-3.2% in Member 2 of Dengying Formation at depth of
5410-5500 m, and 0.1%-7.8% in the Longwangmiao Formation

of bitumen generated. Palaeo-reservoirs began cracking from
the Late Triassic, after finalization of Himalayan structure,
current structural traps were formed on such original slopes.
A part of natural gas accumulating in current gas reservoirs
was sourced from cracking gas of small palaeo-reservoirs, but
might primarily come from cracking gas of dispersed liquid
hydrocarbon migrating from other positions. The Sinian gas
reservoirs in the Weiyuan region are the typical representatives,
where the bitumen content is high, generally greater than 1.0%
(Fig. 7a), but with a narrow vertical distribution range and main
enrichment at the top of the weathered crust of the Dengying
Formation, eg., the bitumen content is 0.30%-6.00% at depth of
3000-3200 m, but sharply reduced to roughly less than 0.10% at
depth of 3250 m-3600 m.

at depth of 4600-4950 m.
The adjusted accumulation-type gas reservoirs have two
circumstances: (1) Large palaeo-reservoirs were formed
at palaeo-uplift highs before the Late Triassic, the palaeoreservoirs began cracking from the Late Triassic, after
finalization of the Himalayan structures, structures at original
palaeo-reservoir positions were changed from palaeo-uplift
highs to current slope zones. Residual palaeo-reservoir cracking
gas mainly accumulated in current gas reservoirs. The Sinian
gas reservoirs in the Ziyang region are typical representatives.
In this region, the bitumen content is high, generally greater
than 1.0% (Fig. 7a), but with a large vertical distribution span,
e.g., the bitumen contents are 0.67%-6.30% at depth of 3400
m, 0.10%-2.47% at depth of 3720-4050m, and 0.10%-2.82% at
depth of 4480-4560 m. The regional bitumen content reflects
the large accumulation area of palaeo-reservoirs in that period.
(2) Adjusted accumulation-type gas reservoirs are located at
palaeo-reservoir slopes in the pathway of oil and gas migration
before the Late Triassic, where reservoir dissolution pores are
developed in small-sized structures, able to form small palaeoreservoirs. After crude oil cracking into gas, a large amount

structures, then small palaeo-reservoirs could be formed, and
after crude oil cracking into gas, more bitumen could also be
produced. If reservoir pores and local small traps were not
developed, then it would be difficult to form reservoir with
lower bitumen content accordingly. After the Late Triassic,
small palaeo-reservoirs gradually started to crack, after
finalization of Himalayan structures, current structural traps
were formed on the original slopes. Natural gas accumulating
in current gas reservoirs was mainly derived from dispersed
liquid hydrocarbon cracking gas migrating from other positions.
Sinian gas reservoirs in the Hebaochang (Well HS 1) region are
the typical representatives with bitumen content of 1.0%-0.50%.
4.1.3 Dispersion-type gas reservoirs
Dispersion-type gas reservoirs are located in slopes or structural
lows for a long time, and there is no palaeo-reservoirs to form.
Dispersed liquid hydrocarbon cracking gas migrating from other
positions mainly accumulated in current gas reservoirs. The gas
reservoirs of the Dengying Formation in Wells ZS 1, GS 1 and

The distribution of different types of gas reservoirs in this region
is shown in Fig. 9. Defining distribution patterns of different
types of gas reservoirs is important to guide prospecting and
exploration of new Sinian-Cambrian reservoirs in the Sichuan
Basin.

4.2 Prediction of favorable zones for natural gas
exploration
Area of high reservoir bitumen content is undoubtedly the
most favorable area and has good accumulation property for
formation of a palaeo-reservoir. However, whether the palaeoreservoir cracking gas can be effectively preserved after
multiphase tectogenetic modification and long-term evolution is
a key problem to be considered in the evaluation and prediction
of favorable zones for natural gas exploration. Prediction basis
is primarily the palaeo-tectonic pattern before massive crude-

oil cracking, abundance of reservoir bitumen remaining in
present reservoirs, favorable reservoiring facies, trap conditions
and preservation conditions. Therefore, distribution area of an
accumulation-type gas reservoir is the most favorable zone, that
of a semi-accumulation and semi-dispersion-type gas reservoir
is the favorable exploration area, and that of a dispersion-type
gas reservoir is a general exploration area.
For to the Sinian Dengying Formation, areas with bitumen
content more than 1.0% are the most favorable exploration zones,
because the platform margin mound-shoal facies are developed
in these areas with large development scale of algal mound
dolomite or shoal facies reservoirs; in the meantime, these areas

are located at the palaeo-uplift highs during the depositional
period, and develop karst reservoirs with smaller buried depth
and shorter distance to the center of hydrocarbon generation;
thus the accumulation conditions are good. The Gaoshiti-Moxi
region is superior to the Weiyuan-Ziyang and Emei areas,
primarily because the former is located at superimposition
points between palaeo-tectonic highs and current tectonic highs
with better preservation conditions (zones I1 in Fig. 9a); the
latter underwent tectogenetic modification, but large groups of
low-magnitude structural traps and stratigraphic-lithologic traps
are developed, so that the early palaeo-reservoir cracking gas
or ex-situ migrated cracking gas can still be captured (zones I2
in Fig. 9a). The areas with bitumen content of 0.2%-1.0% are

favorable exploration areas because during the Sinian, grain
shoals of platform and dissolution vugs were developed. The
areas with bitumen content of 0.5%-1.0% (zones II1 in Fig.
9a) are superior to those with a bitumen content of 0.2%-0.5%
(zones II2 in Fig. 9a). The areas with bitumen content less than
0.2% are the general exploration areas (zones III in Fig. 9a);
these areas are of relatively complex late tectonic conditions,
so the reservoir quality is more poor than the above two areas,
and buried depth is more deep relatively, but to some extent, a
certain size and quantity of Himalayan traps are also developed,
and could capture the late ex-situ migrated cracking gas to form
gas reservoirs.

(2) The Sinian Member 2 and Member 4 of the Dengying
Formation as well as the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation
comprise the following types of gas reservoirs: the bottomwater structural trap type, structure-formation complex type and
tectonic-lithologic type respectively; the pressure coefficient of
gas reservoir transited from 1.07-1.10 of Member 2 and 1.101.13 of Member 4 to 1.53-1.70 of the Longwangmiao Formation,
indicating normal pressure-high pressure gas reservoir, and
difference of the pressure coefficient in the gas reservoir is
related to natural gas diffusion and preservation; temperature
of the central gas reservoir is 137.5-163.28oC, indicating a hightemperature gas reservoir.

For the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation, the areas with
a bitumen content more than 1.0% are the most favorable
exploration areas (zones I in Fig. 9b). Because these areas are
adjacent to hydrocarbon generation center of Lower Cambrian
source rocks, especially the Gaoshiti-Moxi region experienced
underwater palaeo-uplift in the depositional period and
developed large-area grain shoal facies with good accumulation
conditions (zones I 1 in Fig. 9b). In the Longwangmiao
Formation, the favorable exploration areas can be divided
into two levels: (1) The areas with a bitumen content of 0.5%1.0% are the favorable exploration areas which developed
shoal facies reservoir (zones II1 in Fig. 9b). (2) The areas with
a bitumen content less than 0.5% to the palaeo-burial depth of
bottom of the Longwangmiao Formation before the Xujiahe
Formation deposition less than 4500m (zones II 2 area in Fig.
9b), are affected by large-area development of gypsum-salt,
therefore grain shoal facies reservoirs were sparsely distributed
and physical properties are relatively poor, and the palaeostructures and Himalayan traps (present day) are not developed;
but locally, the high-quality shoal facies reservoirs and the
superimposition structure are still favorable exploration areas.
Areas with a burial depth greater than 4500m of the bottom
of the Longwangmiao Formation before Xujiahe Formation
deposition are general exploration areas (zones III in Fig. 9b),
although a certain size of shoal facies reservoirs are developed
in these areas, larger burial depth or lack large tectonic setting,
exploration risk is relatively large.

(3) The Sinian-Cambrian hydrocarbon accumulation conditions
are well in the Sichuan Basin. The large-scale enrichment
of Sinian-Cambrian natural gas in the Gaoshiti-Moxi region
located in stable palaeo-uplift highs for a long time, results from
effective configuration of the large stable inherited palaeo-uplift
during the Tongwan phase, wide distribution of multiple suites
of ancient source rocks, vast high-quality pore-vug reservoirs,
crude oil cracking of large palaeo-reservoirs and favorable
preservation conditions.

5 Conclusions
(1) In the Anyue Gasfield, multiple gas reservoirs are developed
in the Sinian Member 2 and Member 4 of the Dengying
Formation as well as the Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation,
where natural gas components are dominated by hydrocarbon
gases with a methane content of 82.65%-97.35% and lower
C 2+ content, mainly as dry gas of crude-oil cracking type;
non-hydrocarbon gases mainly include N2, CO2, H 2S and He,
characterized by low He content and medium-to-low H 2 S
content.

(4) Based on the palaeo-tectonic pattern before crude oil
cracking of palaeo-reservoirs, and bitumen abundance as
well as distribution of current gas reservoirs, the SinianCambrian natural gas reservoirs can be divided into three types:
accumulation type, semi-accumulation and semi-dispersion type
and dispersion type; and distribution of different types of gas
reservoirs and favorable zones of natural gas exploration are
predicated.
