Abstract: To accurately identify the reservoir characteristics and main controlling factors of the
Cambrian Niutitang black shale in the southeast Chongqing, a series of systematic measurements
were conducted on core samples from Well Yuke-1 and Well Youke-1. The measurements include
clay mineral analysis, XRD analysis, petrophysical properties, specific surface area, pore diameter
and TOC, as well as Ro and maceral compositions. The Niutitang shale reservoir contains detrital
minerals and clay minerals averagely of 51.34% and 32.74%, respectively. The average effective
porosity and permeability are 1.2% and 8.0×10-3mD, respectively, typically of ultra-low porosity
and permeability. Mesopores are dominant, accounting for approximately 73% of the total pore
volume. The average BET specific surface area is 7.75m2/g and the average pore diameter is 5.3nm.
The average TOC is 2.29% and the average Ro is 3.12%, indicating that the organic matter is in
over-maturity stage. Statistical analyses of the measurements show that the micropore volume is
positively correlated with TOC but negatively correlated with the total content of clay minerals; the
mesopore volume is positively correlated with TOC, the total content of clay minerals and the content of carbonate minerals; the macropore volume is positively correlated with TOC and the content of carbonate minerals, weakly positively correlated with the content of detrital minerals but
negatively correlated with the total content of clay minerals. The porosity and TOC of the Niutitang shale are computed using the conventional well-logging method for the Yuke-1 and Youke-1
wells, and the porosities are quite consistent with the core analysis resultsr, but in the shallow reservoir that contains no oil and gas, the TOC exhibits no correlation with the core analysis results.

1 Introduction
Shale gas in natural fractures and intergranular pores is generally in the form of free gas, or absorbed gas in kerogens and
clay particles, or dissolved in kerogens asphalts (Curtis, 2002).
These organic-rich shales are both source rocks and reservoirs
(Martini et al., 1998). Shale gas resources are abundant on a
global scale. In addition to North America, many countries including China, the UK, India and New Zealand also announced

discoveries of shale gas (Dong et al., 2012). On March 1, 2012,
the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources disclosed for the
first time that the geological and recoverable shale gas resources in mainland China excluding the Qinghai-Xizang region
amounted to 134.4×1012 m3 and 25.08×1012 m3, respectively (Yu,
2012). According to Energy Information Administration (EIA,
2013), China possesses the most abundant shale gas resources
in the world with a recoverable shale gas resource up to 31.57
×1012 m3 and has great potentials in the exploitation and utiliza-

The Lower Paleozoic marine shales are extensively developed
in the southeast Chongqing area, mainly including the Lower
Cambrian Niutitang Formation and the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation. These shales are featured by a wide distribution, shallow buried depth, a great thickness and a good fracture
development (Zhang et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2010). The shales
are collected from the Niutitang Formation in Well Yuke-1 and
Well Youke-1 (Fig. 1).

China has recently made important progress in the basic geological theory and understandings regarding the geological features
of organic-rich shales, the geological conditions for the formation
and enrichment of shale gas and the optimal selection of shale-gas
prospect zones, etc. The assessments on shale-gas reservoirs are
mainly conducted in terms of five aspects including: distribution of
organic-rich shale intervals, mineral compositions, characteristics
of micro-nano pores in shale reservoirs, petrophysical properties
and gas-bearing capacity of gas shales (Chen et al., 2010; Nie et al.,
2011). In particular, the pore structures of shale-gas reservoirs have
drawn a wide attention (Chen et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2012). Shale
is an ultra-tight reservoir formation, of which the pore sizes may
be down to several nanometers and are far smaller than those of
sandstone and carbonate reservoirs (Yang et al., 2013). By means of
Ar-ion milling and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FE-SEM), a great number of micro- and nano-scale inorganic
and organic pores can be detected and characterized in shales. The
shale reservoir porosity can thus be quantitatively measured (Ross
and Bustin, 2008; Nelson, 2009). The characteristics of shale-gas
reservoirs are mainly investigated through isothermal adsorption
experiments, analyses of specific surface area and pore diameters
as well as scanning electron microscopy (Xue et al., 2013). Lowtemperature nitrogen adsorption method is widely applied in measuring rocks with high contents of organic matter such as coal and
shale (Clarkson and Bustin, 1999; Tian et al., 2012). However, less
is known about the intrinsic relationships between the assessment
parameters such as pore volume and methane adsorption capacity
and the shale composition characteristics. It is clear that organic
matter is a key factor, whose abundance is positively correlated
with the specific surface area and adsorption capacity of gas shales
(Xue et al., 2013). Accordingly, by using multiple linear regression
method, this study investigates the relationships between the shale
composition characteristics and the effective porosity, pore volume
and BET specific surface area of shale reservoirs to determine the
main controlling factors for the physical properties of reservoirs.
On this basis, the reservoir assessment parameters can be indirectly
calculated based on the shale composition characteristics.

The southeastern part of Chongqing is located in the southeast
margin of Sichuan Basin and on the northwestern side of the
Daloushan Mountains. It lies within the Upper Yangtze Plate.
The pre-Sinian basement is not found in this region. The cap
rock covers from the Cambrian to the Jurassic, with a depositional thickness of up to 8951m (SPBG, 1977). Multi-phase
tectonic movements occurred in this region, characterized by
strong extrusions. Anticlines and fractures were mainly formed
during the Yanshanian Orogeny of the Mesozoic Era, showing a
NE-SW trend. These movements show apparent inheritance and
significant modification to the previous geological structures.
Afterwards, the geological structures in this region are basically
established, and the whole region is uplifted to form the land (Xie
et al., 2013).

Currently, US have successfully exploited five shale gas-bearing
basins commercially (Curtis, 2002). The geological accumulation theory of shale gas has been investigated deeply. The assessment technology for shale-gas reservoirs, perforation optimization technology, fracturing technology and horizontal-well
drilling technology have been developed accordingly (Huang et
al., 2009; Zhao and Yang, 2011).

Niutitang Formation

72 and 16 core samples were collected from Well Yuke-1 and
Well Youke-1, respectively. The encountered formations and
sampling locations of two wells are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,
respectively. Since the core samples collected for this study were
freshly drilled, the measured data are basically not affected by
weathering, and have strong reliability. In the present study, the
analyses of minerals, total organic carbon (TOC) and Ro were
performed using the conventional analytical methods. However,
for some special parameters such as microscopic pore structure
and pore volume in shales, the conventional reservoir characterization method cannot satisfy the accuracy requirements due
to the small pores. Low-pressure nitrogen specific surface measurement method was used to ensure the reliability of measurement results.

Cambrian

Well Yuke-1 and Well Youke-1 were selected as target wells in
the study. Well Yuke-1 is located in the Jinggang Village of the
Youyang County, Chongqing. The Niutitang Formation encountered has a thickness of 60m, and exhibits many well-developed
fractures filled by pyrites, calcites and quartzs. Well Youke-1 is
located in the Baixiang Village of the Youyang County, Chongqing.

porosimeter and an ULTRA-PERM TM 200 permeameter, the
conventional petrophysical property analysis was conducted
under an analytical temperature of 23oC, a humidity of 50%
and atmospheric pressure of 0.1025MPa, when the initial
reference cell pressure for porosity measurement was 0.07MPa.
According to the Determination of the Specific Surface
Area of Solids by Gas Adsorption Using the BET Method
(GB/T 19587-2004) and using the Quadrasorb SI specific
surface area analyser, the samples were heated for an hour at
90oC and 5 hours at 350oC to measure the specific surface areas
and pore diameters, respectively. The measurements of Ro and
macerals were conducted at a temperature of 23o C ± 2 o C in
accordance with the Method for the Measurements of Vitrinite
Reflectance of Sedimentary Rocks (SY/T5124-1995). The
measuring instruments include fluorescence microscope and the
microscope photometer.

4.2 Petrophysical characteristics
The analytical results of the conventional petrophysical properties are
summarized in Table 2. It can be concluded that the pores, cracks and
karst caves are not developed in shales when compared with the condition in the conventional reservoirs such as sandstone and carbonate
reservoirs, etc. Natural gas is mainly stored in the micropores and
micro-cracks of shales (Nie et al., 2009). The shale gas in large pores
and cracks mainly exists in a free state. Compared with the shale gas
absorbed on the surface of mineral particles and organic matters, the
higher the porosity is, the higher the content of free shale gas is (Cheng
and Huang, 2004; Mondol et al., 2007). The effective porosity of the
shales in the Niutitang Formation ranges from 0.4% to 2.7%, with
an average of 1.2%, which is lower than that of the shales in the top
five shale gas producing basins in the US (Curtis, 2002). The shales
in the Niutitang Formation also exhibit fairly low permeability, rang-

182

clays on average, followed by chlorites and I/S mixed-layer minerals. The interlaying ratio of I/S mixed-layer minerals is 5%,
indicating that illites are the main component. The carbonate
minerals account for 0-92%, with an average content of 13.02%,
which are composed mainly of calcites, dolomites and minor
siderites. The content of calcites is quite high in some samples
but is low in most samples. The average content of dolomites is
8.94%. Pyrites are rare in the black shales of the Niutitang Formation.

ing from 1.3×10-3 to 8.8×10-3mD and with an average of 8.0×10-3mD.
According to the Chinese Oil and Gas Industry Standard: Evaluating Methods of Oil and Gas Reservoirs (SY/T 6285-1997), the shale
reservoirs have extremely low porosity and low permeability. The
research shows that the porosity and permeability have no obvious
correlation. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the pores are poorly
connected in the shales, and thus the shale gas is most likely stored in
micropores and micro-cracks.

4.3 Pores, BET specific surface areas and pore sizes
According to the classifications of pores by the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (Rouquerol et
al., 1994), the pores with the diameter smaller than 2nm, ranging from 2 to 50nm and greater than 50nm are referred to as
micropores, mesopores and macropores, respectively.

Table 3 lists the measurement results of BET specific surface areas and pore sizes. In the Niutitang shale, the average volumes of
micropore, mesopore and macropore are 0.69×10-3, 5.99×10-3 and
1.45×10 -3mL/g, respectively, and the average total pore volume
is 8.1×10-3mL/g. Mesopores take up a majority of the total pore
volume, up to 73%, followed by macropores, while the micropore volume is the smallest. The BET specific surface area of
the shales in the Niutitang Formation exhibits a wide variation
from 1.73 to 27.77m 2/g, with an average of 7.75m 2/g. The pore
diameter ranges from 3.1 to 8.0nm, with an average of 5.3nm.

4.4 Organic geochemical characteristics
Table 4 lists the organic carbon analysis and measurement
results of shales. Table 5 shows the measurement results of
solid bitumen reflectance and the calculated results of vitrinite
reflectance in accordance with two empirical formulas proposed
by Zhou and Jacob, i.e., (R o(1) = 0.6569R b + 0.3364 and (R o(2)
= 0.618R b + 0.4)) (Zhou and Pan, 1992). Among the 35 rock
core samples analyzed in the study, the organic matters can
be observed in 16 samples. As shown in Table 4, the TOC of
the Niutitang shale ranges between 0.04% and 9.93%, with
an average of 2.29%, which is similar to that of the Devonian
shale in the Appalachian Basin, Ohio, USA (Curtis, 2002).
Some core samples have very high TOC, which are comparable
to the Barnett Shale in the gas generation window collected
from the Fort Worth Basin, America (Jarvie et al., 2007). For

the collected core samples, the bitumen reflectance (Rb) ranges
from 3.68% to 5.19%, with an average of 4.31%; the vitrinite
reflectance (R o(1)) calculated using the empirical formula of
Zhou ranges from 2.75% to 3.75%, with an average of 3.17%,
which is slightly higher than the R o(2) value calculated from
the empirical formula of Jacob, which gives a range of 2.67%
to 3.61% with an average of 3.07%. Overall, there is little
difference in the vitrinite reflectance calculated by the above
two empirical formulas. The overall average vitrinite reflectance
is approximately 3.12%, suggesting that the shales are presently
in an over-mature stage. The Ro values are higher than those
of the shales from the five top shale gas bearing basins in USA
(Curtis, 2002). The maceral compositions of source rocks
were also investigated, and the results show that the vitrinite
is dominated by a large amount of fragmental and massive
asphalt, and is off-white under the oil-immersed reflected light.
Moreover, no intertinite, exinite and mineral bituminous matrix
can be observed. Based on the organic petrological studies and
microscopic and florescence characteristics of the samples, it
can be concluded that the organic matter abundance is quite
high in some samples.

5 Analysis of main controlling factors
Using the stepwise regression method of multiple linear
regression, the linear relationships between multiple independent
variables and dependent variables were analyzed to investigate
the main controlling factors of physical properties for shalegas reservoirs and their effects. Four independent variables
were used in the present study including the content of detrital
minerals (including quartz and feldspar), the total content of clay
minerals, the content of carbonate minerals (including calcite,
dolomite and siderite) and TOC. For any of these variables, if
the probability F value is smaller than the preset value (defaulted
as 0.05), it can be included in the regression equation; if the
probability F value is greater than the preset value (defaulted
as 0.1), it should be excluded from the regression equation.
Generally, significance tests should be conducted on the
regression equation (mainly including the test of goodness of fit
and F test) and regression coefficients. It should be noted that
the stepwise regression method is employed. This means that
the F test on the regression equation and the significance test
on the regression coefficients are included during the regression
process and the acquired regression results have passed the tests.
Therefore, only the test of goodness of fit is required. Table
6 summarizes the correlation coefficients between the shale
mineral compositions and reservoir properties, and the Pearson
correlation coefficients between independent variables and
dependent variables. Table 7 lists the statistics from regression
models and the variance analysis results, and the multiple
correlation coefficients, sample coefficients of determination,
which are the square of multiple correlation coefficients that
can be used to judge the fitting degree of linear regression
and illustrate how the variations of dependent variables can

X. Cao et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 2,178-190

be explained by independent variables, Table 7 also lists the
multiple determination coefficients, the corrected determination
coefficients are used to eliminate the effects induced by the

number of explanatory variables, the F value and significance
probability for each regression model.

5.1 Main controlling factors of the effective
porosity
As shown in Table 6, the total content of clay minerals is
negatively correlated with the effective porosity. Due to the fact
that the clay minerals have small particles, the pores in clay
minerals and clay aggregates are generally smaller than those
in detrital minerals such as quartz and contribute little to the
effective porosity (Fig. 5). The content of detrital minerals is
positively correlated with the effective porosity because the
detrital minerals have large particles and the intergranular pores
of the large particles are generally large. These characteristics
can also be found in the Barnett shale from the Fort Worth
Basin, USA. Additionally, the content of carbonate minerals
shows a weakly positive correlation with the effective porosity,
while TOC is uncorrelated with the effective porosity.
In the model 1, as shown in Table 7, the multiple determination
coefficient is 0.207 and the significance probability is 0.013,
smaller than 0.05, which suggests that this model has passed the
significance test. The regression equation can be expressed as:
y=-0.028x + 2.167

is negatively correlated with the total content of clay minerals,
with the Pearson correlation coefficient being -0.782.

5.2 Main controlling factors of the pore volume

5.2.2 Mesopore volume

5.2.1 Micropore volume

As shown in Fig. 7, TOC is positively correlated with the
mesopore volume, which is consistent with the findings of Li
et al (2012). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the
total content of clay minerals and mesopore volume is negative,
because the Pearson correlation coefficient only considers the
correlation between two parameters but neglects the effects
of the other factors. Compared with the clay minerals, TOC
imposes more significant controlling effects on the mesopore
volume. Because TOC is negatively correlated with the total
content of clay minerals (with the Pearson correlation coefficient
of -0.546), the increase of TOC corresponds to the decrease of
clay minerals, thus leading to the increase of mesopore volume
that can make up the decrease of mesopore volume caused by
the decline in clay minerals. Accordingly, the total content of
clay minerals is negatively correlated with the mesopore volume.
For the same TOC, the mesopore volume increases with an
increase in the total content of clay minerals. Such an increasing
tendency is quite obvious when TOC is less than 2%. When
TOC is high, the content of organic matters is the principal
factor that controls the development of mesopores, while the
total content of clay minerals has little effects. The content
of carbonate minerals is positively correlated with mesopore
volume and the content of detrital minerals is uncorrelated with
the mesopore volume.

As shown in Fig. 6, TOC exhibits a strongly positive correlation
with the micropore volume. Among the main controlling factors,
TOC imposes the strongest effects on the micropore volume.
The reason lies in the fact that when the organic matters are
in a highly thermal maturation stage ( samples with an average
Ro of 3.12%), micropores would be produced in the diagenesis
reconstruction process, thus reducing the non-uniformity of
pore surface (Ross and Bustin, 2009). The total content of clay
minerals is negatively correlated with the micropore volume.
For the same TOC, the micropore volume is reduced with an
increase in the total content of clay minerals. This conclusion
is consistent with the findings of Ross and Bustin (2009), as
well as Yu et al (2012). For shales with poor organic matters
but abundant clay minerals, the micropore volume is not
subject to the content of organic matters but affected by the
content of clay minerals. For shales with poor clay minerals,
the micropore volume depends mainly on the TOC content. In
the present study, the average content of clay minerals in the
shale is 32.74%, much less than the content of detrital minerals.
Additionally, the contents of carbonate minerals and detrital
minerals have no obvious correlations with micropore volume.

In the model 2, as shown in Table 7, the multiple determination

significant and can be expressed as:
y=-0.001x + 0.003

X. Cao et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 2,178-190

5.2.3 Macropore volume
As shown in Fig. 8, TOC is positively correlated with the
macropore volume, suggesting that TOC is a main controlling
factor for macropore volume. The total content of clay minerals
is negatively correlated with the macropore volume. For the
same TOC, the macropore volume decreases as the total content
of clay minerals increases, indicating that the macropores
are not developed in clay minerals. The content of carbonate
minerals is positively correlated with the macropore volume.
During late diagenesis, macropores may be formed in calcites
and dolomites due to the dissolution effects. Additionally, the
content of detrital minerals has a weakly positive correlation
with the macropore volume, which is consistent with the
findings of Yu et al (2012), Li et al (2012), Wu et al (2012) and
Zeng et al (2013).
In the model 4, as shown in Table 7, the multiple determination
coefficient is 0.919, and the significance probability is close
to 0, far less than 0.05, suggesting that the model has passed
the significance test and the regression equation is highly
significant. The regression equation can be expressed as:
y = 5×10-4 x + 2×10-4

(4)

Where y denotes the macropore volume (mL/g) and x denotes
the TOC (%).

total pore volume. The Pearson correlation coefficient between
the total content of clay minerals and total pore volume is
negative, which is similar to the relationship between the total
content of clay minerals and mesopore volume. TOC imposes
greater effects on the total pore volume than the clay minerals
does. Therefore the increase of total pore volume caused by the
increasing TOC can offset the decrease caused by the decline
in the total content of clay minerals. For the same TOC, the
higher the total content of clay minerals is, the larger the total
pore volume is. The content of carbonate minerals is positively
correlated with the total pore volume, while the content of
detrital minerals is slightly correlated with the total pore
volume.
In the model 5, as shown in Table 7, the multiple determination
coefficient is 0.800, and the significance probability is close
to 0. Similarly, the model has passed the significance test
since the significance probability is far smaller than 0.05. The
regression equation is highly significant and can be expressed as:
y = 2×10-3x1 + 3.67×10-6 x2 + 4×10-3

5.2.4 Total pore volume
As shown in Fig. 9, TOC has good positive correlation with the

TOC shows a strongly positive correlation with the BET specific
surface area, indicating that TOC is a main controlling factor of
the BET specific surface area. This is because that pores are well
developed in organic matters, resulting in a large specific surface area,
as shown in Fig. 10. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of
Ross and Bustin (2009). The Pearson correlation coefficient between
the total content of clay minerals and the BET specific surface area
is negative. As described above, TOC has more obvious and stronger

187

X. Cao et al./Petroleum Research (2016) 2,178-190

controlling effects on the BET specific surface area than the clay
minerals has. For shales with a relative low content of clay minerals
and high TOC, the increase of the BET specific surface area induced
by the increase of TOC can counteract the decrease of the BET
specific surface area induced by the reduction of the total content of
clay minerals. In other words, the total content of clay minerals is
negatively correlated with the BET specific surface area. For the same
TOC, the BET specific surface area tends to increase with the total
content of clay minerals increase. This is due to the fact that the clay
minerals generally have small particles and some clay minerals such
as smectite have internal surfaces. The contents of carbonate minerals
and detrital minerals show no obvious correlations with the BET
specific surface area, because carbonate minerals and detrital minerals
always have large particles and thus small specific surface areas.

6 Well-logging evaluation
To further document the relationships between the characteristic
parameters of the Niutitang shale and the geophysical
exploration information and to explore the feasibility of welllogging method to evaluate the characteristic parameters of
shale, logging data of Well Yuke-1 and Well Youke-1 were
processed using a new generation of well-logging software
CIFLog developed by PetroChina (Li et al., 2013). The primary
computing methods refer to Reference Li (1989).
Fig. 11 illustrates the logging interpretation results of Well Yuke1. Conventional log data are used in the study. The Niutitang shales
have extremely shallow buried depths, indicating there is highly
unlikely any viable oil and gas resource. The logging interpreting
evaluation focused on the calculation of porosity, TOC and the
total content of clay minerals. It can be observed that, although the
Niutitang shales from Well Yuke-1 have low porosity, the calculated
results of porosity based on the neutron log data are in good
consistency with the core analysis results. Most significantly, it is
more efficient to calculate the TOC using neutron log curve rather
than using the natural gamma (GR) curve, suggesting that TOC of
the sample from the shallow reservoir without oil and gas exhibits
no obvious correlation with the total content of clay minerals.

from that of Well Yuke-1, the Niutitang shales in Well Youke-1
are located in depths of over 1300m below the ground. There is
oil and gas shows in the Niutitang shales. However, the Niutitang
shales in Well Youke-1 have low porosity, similar to that in Well
Yuke-1, and the porosities calculated from neutron log data also
have good consistency with the core analysis results. In addition,
the calculated results of TOC based on the GR log have better
consistency with the core analysis results than those based on the
neutron log data, which is different from that of Well Yuke-1.

7 Conclusions
(1) The Niutitang shales in southeast Chongqing are mainly
composed of detrital minerals and clay minerals as well as small
amounts of carbonate minerals and pyrites. The detrital minerals occupy approximately 50%, which have a large proportion
of quartzs and a small amount of feldspars (dominated by plagioclases); the clay minerals occupy approximately 1/3 of the
total, in which chlorites, illites and I/S mixed layer minerals can
be observed with illite being the main content of clay materials.
There is a low content of carbonate minerals, mainly including
calcites, dolomites and siderites, and pyrites are rare.
(2) The Niutitang shales are characterized by extremely low
porosity and permeability. The average total pore volume is 8.1
×10 -3mL/g with the mesopore volume taking up approximately
73% of the total pore volume, successively followed by macropores and micropores. The BET specific surface areas vary
greatly among different samples and have an average value of
7.75m2/g, while the average pore diameter is 5.3nm. The average
TOC is 2.29% and the average value of Ro is 3.12%, suggesting
that the shales are in over-maturity stage.
(3) The total content of clay minerals is negatively correlated with
the effective porosity. The content of detrital minerals is positively

correlated with the effective porosity. The content of carbonate
minerals exhibits a weakly positive correlation with the effective
porosity. The micropore volume is positively correlated with TOC
but negatively correlated with the total content of clay minerals. The
mesopore volume is positively correlated with TOC, the contents
of clay minerals and carbonate minerals. The macropore volume
shows positive correlations with TOC and the content of carbonate minerals, but a weakly positive correlation with the content of
detrital minerals and a negative correlation with the total content of
clay minerals. The total pore volume is positively correlated with
TOC, the total content of clay minerals and the content of carbonate minerals. In addition, the BET specific surface area is positively
correlated with TOC and the total content of clay minerals. Most
importantly, TOC is the main controlling factor that imposes the
strongest effect on pore volume and BET specific surface area.
(4) According to the well-logging evaluation results, it is feasible
to determine the porosity and TOC of the Niutitang shales using the conventional well-logging method. The porosities of two
wells calculated based on the neutron log data fit well with core
analysis results. However, it should be noted that, for Well Yuke1, the calculated results of TOC based on GR curve exhibits no
obvious correlation with core analysis results.
