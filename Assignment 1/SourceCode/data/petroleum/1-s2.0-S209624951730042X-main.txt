Abstract: For further study on characteristics of micro-pores in the marine shale reservoirs in Northwest
Guizhou, shale samples in the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation were selected to investigate effect
of micro-pores on the characteristics of gas accumulation in shales, through methods of the argon broad
ion beam-field emission scanning electron microscope and the nitrogen adsorption/desorption, analysis
on the characteristics of micro-pores and related geochemical analysis. Results show that there are
seven types of pores in the Longmaxi Formation shale, including interparticle pores, intraparticle pores,
intercrystalline pores, dissolution pores, fossil pores, organic pores, and microfractures, among which
the interparticle pores and organic pores are best developed. According to the nitrogen adsorption/
desorption curves, the pore structures can be classified into three types, including the cylindrical pores
with both opening ends, narrow parallel-plate pores and tapered parallel-plate pores with four opening
sides. Diameter of micro-pores ranges from 2 to 64 nm, mainly at 2-6 nm. The diameter of micro-pores
(less than 2 nm) ranges from 0.4 to 1.8 nm, The micro-pores with a diameter of 0.4-1.0 nm contribute
most to the pore volume. Pore volume is dominated by meso-pores (2-50 nm) with a proportion of
83.1%. The micro-pores and meso-pores make major contribution to the specific surface area of pores
with proportions of 20.1% and 79.3%, respectively. The total organic carbon (TOC) is the major
factor controlling development of nanopores. Different pore types have different characteristics of gas
occurrence and migration, indicating that nanopores provide favorable conditions for the occurrence and
microscopic migration of gas in shales.

1 Introduction
As the exploration and exploitation of shale gas have been
increasingly drawn worldwide attention, China has also
enhanced its investment into shale gas, especially in the

southern areas where breakthroughs in the exploration and
development of shale gas have been made successively (Nie
and Zhang, 2011; Guo and Zhang, 2014; Jia et al., 2014),
which requires further investigation into shale gas. Although
shale is characterized by low porosity and low permeability,

This study mainly focuses on shale of the Lower Silurian
Longmaxi Formation. Core samples from two wells and field
outcrop samples were chosen to conduct BIB-FESEM and
nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests (Table 1).

The study area is located in the northwest of Guizhou Province.
Tectonically, it is located in the upper Yangtze Plate and its
main body is situated in the central Guizhou uplift area, which
is an EW-trending uplift zone of the early Paleozoic. In the early
Silurian, the southern areas of Northwest Guizhou gradually
lifted up to form a continent due to Duyun movement (Xiao et
al., 2005), leading to the continuous northward retrogradation of
marine sediments in Northwest Guizhou. Consequentially, black
shale deposits were developed with a nearly EW distribution in
deepwater shelf and stagnant basin of the Longmaxi Formation
only to the north of Bijie-Zunyi area (Guo and Zhang, 2014) (Fig.
1). In the Northwest Guizhou, the Longmaxi Formation becomes
gradually thinner from the north to the south with the maximum
thickness being up to 50m. According to the microconstituent
analysis, the organic matter of the Longmaxi Formation mainly
consists of sapropelite and scattered mineral-bituminous matrix,
while the types of organic matter are mainly type I and type II1;
the Longmaxi Formation has high total organic carbon (TOC),
ranging from 1% to 6%; R o is commonly high (greater than
2%), indicating the high-mature gas generation phase. Mineral
constituents are mainly clastic and clay minerals as well as some
carbonates and minor pyrite (Fig. 2). Among these minerals,
clastic mineral takes up 23%-66% with an average of 40.5%,
and dominated by quartz; while clay minerals account for 22%-

the massive development of pore space dominated by micropores makes shale have certain accumulation capacity (Chen
et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013a; Yu et al., 2013; Guo and Zhang,
2014; Jia et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014). At present, there is no
unified scheme for classification of pores in unconventional
shale reservoirs (Loucks and Ruppel, 2007; Slatt and O’Neal,
2011; Chalmers et al., 2012). Researches show that diameter of
pores in mud shale is mainly in the nanoscale, which is hardly
observed with conventional techniques. At abroad, the types and
characteristics of nanopores in mud shale are mainly observed
by using argon broad ion beam technique and scanning
electronic microscopy with high resolution (Chen et al., 2012),
which has provided advanced techniques for the investigation
in the micro-characteristics of shale gas accumulation. Apart
from reasonable experimental design and acquired drilling core
samples and outcrop samples from the Longmaxi Formation in
Northwest Guizhou, argon broad ion beam technique and field
emission scanning electronic microscopy (BIB-FESEM) were
also used in the experiment. For verification of the experimental
results and quantitative investigation, nitrogen adsorption/
desorption experiment was performed on the samples. In this
way, the types and characteristics of pores in the marine shale in
Northwest Guizhou can be classified and analyzed for genesis.
The effect of nanopores on the gas accumulation characteristics
was also discussed.

Gatan 691.CS argon ion polisher was used for sample polishing
and preparation, mainly including following steps: sample
pregrinding, sample pretreatment using high-energy argon ion
beam system, deposition of the conductive film onto the sample
surface, gold sputtering and SEM observation. In the SEM
observation, minerals can be differentiated by color and form.

Meanwhile, with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), mineral
composition and content can be more accurately determined.
Samples polished by argon ions have smooth and flat surface,
and the back-scattered electron imaging is more favorable for
the observation of the microstructure and form of nanopores.
For the qualitative and quantitative characterization of type
and characteristics of the micro-pores observed under SEM,
the nitrogen adsorption and desorption test was performed to
verify the pore features, and the structure and features of micropores were also analyzed. In nitrogen adsorption/desorption test,
the multilayer isothermal adsorption equation (BET) and BJH
algorithm were used to characterize specific surface area as well
as the distribution of pore volume and pore diameter (Brunauer
et al., 1938; Yan et al., 1979). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption
was carried out by a Quadrasorb SI static cryogenic automatic
nitrogen sorption analyzer developed, the relative pressure of
adsorption/desorption is 0.005-0.995, and the measured pore
diameter is 0.35-400nm.

proposed by Loucks, i.e., interparticle pores, intraparticle pores
and organic pores (Rouquerol et a., 1994). The advantages of
this classification include simplicity, feasibility, good suitability
and a comprehensive consideration of hydrocarbon wettability
of all pore types and differences of the gas flowing in the pores.
Compared with the stable marine organic-rich mud shale strata
in North America, the organic-rich mud shale in China is
greatly different in sedimentary facies, geological evolution and
organic geochemical and physical properties, and thus unique in
terms of the types and characteristics of pores.
In accordance with principles of objectivity, suitability and
uniformity, and based on the pore classification after Loucks
et al., the authors employed BIB-FESEM technique to test
the shale samples of the Longmaxi Formation in Northwest
Guizhou, and then classified pore types depending on the
structure, genesis and geochemical characteristics of pores
coupled with relationship between pore development and matrix
(Table 2).

4 Types and characteristics of pores

4.1 Matrix pores

The academia has great dispute on the classification of pores in
shale reservoirs (Nelson, 2009), mainly because principles and
bases of pore classification are contradictory to its universality
and simplicity. The most classic classification of the pores in
the north American marine shale is the “trichotomy” method

Matrix has different pore types, including interparticle pores
formed by irregular stacking of particles, dissolution pores
formed after the dissolution of quartz particles, fossil pores
formed from paleontological fossils, and organic pores between
the particles of organic matter. Through compilation and

morphologies which are mainly triangle, polygon and line
forms (Figs. 3a-c and Figs. 4c-f). Such pore forms are closely
related to mineral composition, for example, linear pores are
typically found in the flocculent aggregate of clay minerals
(Figs. 3d-f and 4h). The connectivity of interparticle pores is
usually good, especially the “cardhouse structure” which can be
formed in clay minerals (Bennett et al., 1991; Ross and Bustin,
2007), these pores can provide favorable seepage paths for
methane molecules (0.38 nm). In this study, brittle minerals and
flocculent clay minerals can form the most interparticle pores

4.1.1 Inorganic pores
(1) Interparticle pores

and tight shale reservoirs due to joint effect of sedimentation,

because they are commonly developed in minerals.
(2) Intraparticle pores
Intraparticle pores are well developed inside particles with
a common pore diameter up to 200 nm, among which the
intraparticle pores are best developed between the layers of
clay minerals (Figs. 3e, 4d and 4h), but less developed in
other minerals (Fig. 3i). Illite content is the highest in the clay
minerals, within which many intraparticle pores are found,
which were probably formed when montmorillonite or other
unstable minerals transformed into illite or other minerals in the
process of sedimentation and accumulation (Lee et al., 2010).
Some of the interlayer pores can be filled by other minerals
(Fig. 3f), which might be related to the late diagenesis and
evolution. The intraparticle pores can provide large space for the
occurrence of gas, and also form the pore network together with
interparticle pores, thereby dramatically enhance the seepage
ability of the hydrocarbon in shale.
(3) Intercrystalline pores
In the shale of the Longmaxi Formation, pyrites are commonly
developed and mainly occure in microspherical and framboidal
druses. Intercrystalline pores are usually developed in pyrites,
which are formed by the incompact stacking during the growth
of crystals. The pore diameter is mostly within the range of
20-1000 nm, with the certain connectivity inside. Besides,
intercrystalline pores are also commonly found in quartz,
feldspar, calcite minerals.
(4) Dissolution pores
During geological evolution, unstable minerals including quartz,
carbonate minerals and clay minerals can dissolve to form pores
under the effect of sedimentation, tectonics, the generation and
evolution of hydrocarbon, which requires strong in-situ stress,
high temperature or other conditions. The dissolution pores are
well developed in the shale of the Longmaxi Formation because
the shale is at the high-mature stage following remarkable deep
burial and hydrocarbon generation processes (Figs. 3b, 3c and
3i). Sometimes, the dissolution pores could be partly or fully
refilled by quartz, clay, etc., thus the unfilled dissolution pores
can serve as the occurrence space of gas.
(5) Fossil pores
It is found that there are a small number of paleontological
fossils in shale with variable morphology which are generally
well preserved, probably because the shale of the Longmaxi
Formation belongs to abyssal sedimentation, providing favorable
conditions for the preservation of fossils. Pores are developed
in the skeletons and coeloms of the fossils with generally
large diameter of micron order (Fig. 3g), which have favorable

connectivity and can offer a migration pathway and occurrence
space for gas molecules. But sometimes the fossil pores could
be filled by quartz, carbonate minerals, clay minerals, etc., thus
losing the functions mentioned above (Chen et al., 2012).
4.1.2 Organic pores
Organic pores are commonly distributed in the organic matter
of the Longmaxi shales. These are scattered in the shale matrix,
but occure in many shapes, e.g., gneissic, elliptical, linear, etc.
(Fig. 4a and 4c). The pore diameter is generally of the nanoscale
(Fig. 4b), usually 5-300 nm, belonging to meso-pores and macropores. A related research shows that only when Ro of organic
matter reaches 0.6%, organic matter pores would be developed
(Dow, 1977), indicating that organic matter pores are closely
related to hydrocarbon generation and evolution of organic
matter (kerogen) . The formation of this kind of pores is due to
the consumption of organic constituents during the hydrocarbon
generation of kerogen, or the contraction pore-fractures from the
water consumption during hydrocarbon generation. Besides, the
formation of organic pores is also related to type and abundance
of the organic matter.
It is found that organic matter does not exist alone, usually
occurring with clay minerals, quartz, carbonate minerals, pyrite,
etc. in the form of adsorption, wrapping or filling (Figs. 4d–h),
which has been verified in the elemental composition acquired
by EDS (Fig. 4i). This kind of aggregate of organic matter is
favorable for the development of pores (Nelson, 2009; Yang et
al., 2014), for example, many pores are found in the symbiont of
organic matter and clay minerals.
Organic matter pores are substantially developed in the shale
of the Longmaxi Formation, having certain connectivity
with interparticle and intraparticle pores, so as to provide
microseepage paths for occurrence and migration of gas in shale
reservoirs.

4.2 Fractured pores
Microfractures, which are generally of microscale, might be
related to the change of stress caused by micro-sedimentary
tectonics or late diagenesis, and have no relationship with the
matrix of rocks. Microfractures are abundant in the Longmaxi
Formation shale (Fig. 5), characterized by various shapes and
good extensibility, mostly no wider than 400nm. Microfractures
are usually open and can interconnect with other types of
pores to form intricate solid seepage network, which is of great
significance to the microscopic migration of gas. Although
microfractures would lose the ability of seepage filled by
cements like quartz and carbonate minerals, these fractures still
play a role in fracturing modification during late exploitation
(Bowker, 2007).

4.3 Comparison of pore characteristics between
the shale of marine, continental, and marinecontinental transition facies
Influenced by the complicated geological setting and multiphase evolution, the development of shale in China varies much
in different areas, especially in terms of type of organic matter,
mineral constituents, and organic geochemical characteristics,
making development of micro-pores in mud shale chang
dramatically. The continental shale in China was formed in a

196

relatively late age (Yang et al., 2013a) and dominated by the
Mesozoic to Cenozoic strata in the northern China, such as
the shale of the Triassic Yangchang Formation in the Ordos
Basin and the shale of the Cretaceous the Qingshankou
Formation in the Songliao Basin (Huang et al., 2013), but was
less distributed in the southern China. The thermal evolution
degree of organic matter is generally not high, but the content
of clay minerals is considerable (Gao et al., 2013; Guo et al.,
2013), then the intraparticle pores in clay minerals are well
developed. Organic-rich shale of marine-continental transition

facies is widely distributed in upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic,
such as the Upper Carboniferous Taiyuan Formation in the
Qinshui Basin and the Upper Permian Longtan Formation
in the Upper Yangtze area. Various types of pores are
developed in shale due to various types of organic matter,
moderate thermal evolution degree, and complicated mineral
constituents dominated by clastic and clay minerals. Marine
shale is mainly developed in the southern China at an early
age generally within Paleozoic, such as the black shale of the
Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation, the Lower Silurian
Longmaxi Formation, and the Middle Devonian Luofu
Formation. Evolution of organic matter in marine shale has

been in mature to over-mature stage, with high content of
clastic minerals, especially such brittle minerals as quartz and
calcite, and low content of clay minerals, which might be why
many organic matter pores and interparticle pores in marine
shale. The organic-rich shale of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi
Formation is dominated by abyssal shelf sediments with high
degree of thermal maturity, and the mineral constituents are
chiefly clastic minerals with pyrite. As a result, organic matter
pores and interparticle pores are substantially developed, and
intraparticle pores are also well developed. Besides, there are
also some dissolution pores and fossil pores in shale due to the
sedimentary environment and geological evolution (Table 3).

5 Characterization of pores in shale using
nitrogen adsorption/desorption test
Pores in shale of the Longmaxi Formation in Northwest
Guizhou have various types and complex pore structure, among
which organic pores and interparticle pores are most developed.
Concerning that the scanning electron microscopy is just a
qualitative reflection of the types and structures of pores, the
range and results of our observation have some limitation.
But on the other hand, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption is a
favorable characterization of the micro-pores in shale (Yang

Mainly cylindrical pores and
Mainly intraparticle pores and
organic matter pores (Yang et al., parallel plate pores (Yang et al.,

Mainly cylindrical pores,
amorphous pores and tapered
plate pores (Yang et al., 2014)

et al., 2013b). Therefore, the characteristics of the nitrogen
adsorption/desorption curves at low temperature were also
analyzed. Hence, structures of the micro-pores in shale were
characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively.

5.1 Nitrogen adsorption/desorption test
In order to better characterize the structures of shale pores,
the nitrogen adsorption and desorption test at low temperature
was performed on 12 drilling shale samples of the Longmaxi
Formation. At present, classification of the adsorption/desorption
curve is commonly used from Brunauer (Yan et al., 1979).

At a relative pressure of 0.4-0.6, an obvious inflection point
appears in the desorption curve; when the relative pressure
is over 0.6, the separation between the adsorption curve and
the desorption curve is large under the effect of capillary
condensation; when the relative pressure is lower than 0.4, both
curves nearly coincide, indicating large adsorption volume.
This type of shale pores are mainly regular cylindrical pores
with both opening ends, narrow parallel-plate pores, and some
amorphous pores, such as tapered tube pores with both opening
ends or ink-bottle-shaped pores.

(2) Type B (Figs. 7f-i)
It has similar curve shape to that of type A with a smoother
inflection point; when the relative pressure is lower than 0.4,
there is also separation between the adsorption and desoprtion
curves, which may be caused by the strong capillary condensation
occurring in a certain number of micro-pores in shale, and has to
be overcome with lower relative pressure; the adsorption volume
is large. This type of curves correspond to narrow parallel-plate
pores, as well as some tapered plate pores with four opening sides
and the tapered tube pores with both opening ends.
(3) Type C (Figs. 7j-l)
The inflection point is not obvious, adsorption and desorption
curves are nearly parallel with small separation, indicating small
adsorption volume. This type of curves corresponds to tapered plate
pores with four opening sides and a few narrow parallel-plate pores.
The above analysis of adsorption and desorption curves
demonstrates that the pores in shale of the Longmaxi Formation in

different samples, and divided the adsorption/desorption curves

types as follows.

Through comparison, the curve of the Longmaxi Formation
shale is a reverse S, which is very close to the typical adsorption/
desorption curve for harmonic multi-layer adsorption. However,
considering diversity and complexity of the types of shale
pores, the real curve is not the characterization of a single
type of pore structure, but the complicated superposition of
different typical curves (Chen et al., 2012), indicating that the
adsorption of shale is a combined action of multiple adsorption
states. The adsorption and desorption curves exhibit separation
characteristic, implying that there is capillary agglomeration
in shale pores, and there is no saturated adsorption when the
balance pressure reaches the saturated vapor pressure because
of the meso-pores and large pores in shale. By studying the
relationship between the curves and pore types (Fig. 6), the
authors further studied differences in the shape of the curves for

Northwest Guizhou are mainly open pores because closed pores
do not have a desorption curve, and that the open pores are mainly
cylindrical pores and parallel-plate pores. Further analysis of the
adsorption and desorption curves in conjunction with the analysis
of the mineral constituents in shale, it is found that cylindrical
pores or tapered tube pores are mainly organic matter pores and
interparticle pores, while parallel-plate pores and tapered plate
pores are related to interlayer intraparticle pores or microfractures
in clay minerals. Therefore, it can be deduced that pores in shale
of the Longmaxi Formation are mainly organic matter pores and
interparticle pores, with development of some intraparticle pores
and microfractures between the layers of clay minerals, which is in
accordance with characteristics of pores observed using SEM.

5.2 Specific surface area, volume and diameter
distribution of pores
Using BET adsorption isotherm equation, the specific surface
area of Longmaxi Formation shale is 10.735-24.646 m 2/g with

The distribution of shale pore volume and pore diameter can be
studied using BJH model. The pore volume of shale samples is
0.0068-0.0132 mL/g with an average of 0.0095 mL/g, while the
average pore diameter of the samples is 32.204-73.937 nm with
an average of 53.239 nm. The pore distribution can be obtained
by DFT method (Fig. 8), which can reflect the contribution
of pore diameter to pore volume. The pore diameter of the
Longmaxi Formation shale in Northwest Guizhou is 0-64 nm
with multiple peaks, and the major peaks mainly are at 2-6 nm.

5.3 Characteristics of the micro-pores
The BET specific surface area is a sum of the specific surface
area (SSA) of all pores, because SSA of micro-pores cannot
be individually characterized. BJH method is more accurate
in characterizing the volume and diameter of meso-pores and
macro-pores, but can have large error in characterizing micropores. Therefore, neither BET method nor BJH method can be
used to specifically depict and characterize micro-pores. T-plot is
commonly used in evaluating the micro-pore features of porous

media, including the SSA and volume of micro-pores. Generally,
the adsorption curves are used in the nitrogen adsorption/desorption
test. The data corresponding to relative pressure of 0-0.6 are used
to calculate the SSA and volume of micro-pores. The JW-BK 132F
cryogenic nitrogen adsorption analyzer was used for the test of
the shale core samples. The means of SSA and volume of shale
micro-pores obtained using T-plot are 6.94 m2/g and 0.003 mL/g
respectively. Comparison between the SSA and volume obtained by
T-plot (Table 5) shows that micro-pores can provide larger SSA at
a given volume. DFT method is based on Tarazona state equation,
and can be used to evaluate distribution of pore diameter within the
testing range, but the distribution of pore diameter is wider, from
which the micro-pore features obtained are limited. In order to
further analyze the distribution feature of micro-pore diameter, HK
method is used based on Horvaih-Kawazoe equation to calculate
the micro-pore diameters and distribution. The distribution curves
of micro-pores show that the distribution range of micro-pore
diameter is 0.4-1.8 nm with a single peak (Fig. 9). The micro-pores
with a diameter of 0.4-1.0 nm contribute most to the volume of
micro-pores.

Characterization of pore diameter mainly follows the classification
standard established by International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC) based on physical adsorption features and the
capillary condensation theory, pore structures are mainly classified
by pore diameter into micro-pores (<2 nm), meso-pores (2-50
nm), and macro-pores (>50 nm) (Rouquerol et al., 1994; Xue et al.,
2013). According to the results (testing range from 0.35 to 400 nm),
the percentages of pore volume and SSA versus pore diameter were
plotted (Fig. 10). The pore volume of the Longmaxi Formation
shale is dominated by meso-pores, which take up 76.9%-92.1% with
an average of 83.1%. Micro-pores and macro-pores take up smaller
proportion of pore volume, for example, micro-pores account for
3.7%-9.9% with an average of 6.5%, while the proportion of macropores is 3.5%-15.9 with an average of 10.4%. Meso-pores take the
overwhelming part in SSA of pores, too, which is 52.3%-88.2%
with an average of 79.3%. Meanwhile, the contribution of micropores to SSA is not neglectable, which take up 10.6%-47.4% with
an average of 20.1%. The macro-pores has minimum contribution
to the SSA of pores, which is 0.3%-1.2% with an average of 0.5%.
In the shale of the Longmaxi Formation, meso-pores mainly
contribute to the volume of nanopores, while the meso-pores with
diameter less than 50 nm and micro-pores mainly contribute to
SSA for the adsorption of gas.

or micro-pores. Besides, the SSA of quartz is less than 20 m 2/
g (Kennedy et al., 2002), which might account for insignificant
relations of brittle minerals versus the volume and SSA of pores.
The SSA of montmorillonite in clay minerals can reach 800
m 2/g, while the SSA of illite is only 30 m 2/g, and the SSA of
kaolinite and chlorite are usually less than 10 m2/g. Therefore,
montmorillonite contributes most to the SSA. Because the SSA
of clay minerals is low in the Longmaxi Formation shale which
is dominated by illite, and the illite particles are large enough
to form the interparticle pores and interlayered pores at nanoto micro-scale (Bowker, 2007; Ji et al., 2012), micro-scale
pores also have a considerable contribution to the SSA and pore
volume, which might have weaken the effect of clay minerals on
the SSA and volume of nanopores.

complicated. Studies have been conducted on the relations of
TOC, clay minerals, and brittle minerals versus nanopores.
Many researchers hold that TOC has obvious effect on
nanopores, while others propose that clay minerals also have
some effect on pore volume and SSA (Yan et al., 1979; Loucks
and Ruppel, 2007; Ross and Marc, 2009). Through analysis of
relations of pore volume and SSA versus TOC, clay minerals,
and brittle minerals, TOC is well positively correlated with
volume and SSA of nanopores (Figs. 11a-b), with 0.870 and
0.796 of correlation coefficients respectively. TOC and the
maturity of organic matter are both high, organic pores and
micro-pores in the polymeric form of kerogen macromolecules
are commonly developed (Yang et al), which contributes a lot
to the SSA and pore volume, indicating that TOC is the major
factor affecting development of nanopores in the Longmaxi
Formation shale. Relations of brittle minerals and clay minerals
versus pore volume and SSA are not obvious (Figs. 11c-f).
Brittle minerals are dominated by quartz, which is favorable
to the development of fractures. Considering that this study
mainly tests the pores with a diameter of no larger than 400
nm, brittle minerals may contribute significantly larger pores

when the pore diameter reaches 50 nm, the interaction between
methane molecules or between molecules and the wall of
pores can change the thermodynamic state of gas, causing the
movement of molecules in pores to get rid of the adsorbed state
(Krishna, 2009). Pores within the testing range are likely to
be dominated by the occurrence in the form of free gas, which
may be the major reason of the unobvious relationship between
porosity and the gas adsorption capacity. Organic carbon has
great adsorption capacity, which provides material basis for
the adsorption of gas (Han et al., 2013), meanwhile massivelydeveloped organic pores also provide plenty of space for gas
occurrence, so TOC is perfectly positively correlated with the
gas adsorption capacity. The SSA and pore volume of nanopores
in shale are also positively correlated with gas adsorption
capacity (Fig. 12), with 0.889 and 0.805 of cor relation
coefficients respectively. Micro-pores with a diameter of 2-62
nm have very strong gas adsorption capacity. Combining
the testing range of pore diameter and the distribution
characteristics, it can be concluded that adsorption is the main
occurrence of gas in the micro-pores of shale. On this basis, the
gas accumulation capacity of shale is directly related to the size
of pore throat and the pore diameter, specifically, bigger pore
throat is more favorable for the migration of methane molecules.
The adsorption of gas molecules is not monolayer adsorption,
greater pore diameter can not only lead to larger SSA, but also
provide more space for multilayer adsorption. Therefore, the
SSA and pore volume of the nanopores in shale, have good
positive correlation with the gas adsorption capacity (Fig. 13).

The gas adsorption capacity of the Longmaxi Formation shale is
0.60-3.84 m3/t with an average of 2.18 m3/t (Fig. 12). In order to
study the factors affecting the gas adsorption capacity of shale,
correlation analysis was carried out over gas adsorption capacity
relative to porosity, TOC, SSA of BET, and total pore volume
of BJH method. In order to reduce the influence of TOC on gas
adsorption capacity and better reflect the relationship between
porosity and gas adsorption capacity, correlation analysis of
porosity and the adsorbed gas of unit TOC was done, indicating
insignificant correlation. In terms of the porosity test of shale,
the effective testing diameter in current method is quite large,
which is generally of micron grade. Related study shows that

Micro-pores can not only provide large space of occurrence for
gas, but also enhance the adsorption capacity of pores. Different
types of pores have different characteristics in occurring state
and migration mode of gas. Interparticle pores are mostly large
with a diameter of micron grade. These are ideal places for
accumulation of free natural gas which can migrate by means
of seepage or diffusion. Intraparticle pores, which are mostly
of nanoscale, are usually developed in clay minerals to provide
occurrence space for the adsorbed natural gas. Besides, due to
small pore diameter, gas in intraparticle pores mainly migrate
by diffusion. High TOC and high maturity of organic matter
in the marine shale of the Longmaxi Formation, which organic
matter pores are well developed and the adsorption capability
of organic matter is large, provide a favorable reserving space
for adsorbed natural gas; the organic pores are mainly of nanoscale, where diffusion is the major means of gas migration.
Compared with intraparticle pores, organic matter pores in the
continuous organic framework are relatively interconnected and
can form effective pore systems so as to become the dominant
flow path. Intercrystalline pores and dissolution pores are
commonly developed inside or between mineral particles,
which can provide some space for occurrence of free natural
gas. Large-sized microfractures are massively developed in
the Longmaxi Formation shale, which is the major site for
occurrence of free natural gas and also provide effective micro
paths for its seepage. The pores in shale of the Longmaxi
Formation have various types with complicated internal
structures, and are interconnected each other to form dense
network of seepage, enabling micro-migration and occurrence
of gas, and improving the gas-bearing capacity of shale.

7 Conclusions
(1) Pores in the Longmaxi Formation shale can be divided into
seven types, including interparticle pores, intraparticle pores,
intercrystalline pores, fossil pores, dissolution pores, organic
matter pores, and microfractures; the organic matter pores are
best developed under effect of high maturity; among inorganic
pores, the interparticle pores are relatively well developed, the
interlayer intraparticle pores are also developed due to high
content of clay minerals.
(2) The adsorption/desorption experiment shows that pores in the
Longmaxi Formation shale are mostly open, mainly including
cylindrical pores with both opening ends, narrow parallel-plate
pores and tapered plate pores with four opening sides, as well
as some tapered tube pores with both opening ends and inkbottle-shaped pores. The diameter of micro-pores ranges from
2 to 64 nm and mainly concentrates at 2-6 nm. The micro-pore
diameter ranges from 0.4 to 1.8 nm, and the micro-pores with a
diameter of 0.4-1.0 nm contribute most to the volume of micropores.

(3) The volume of pores in the Longmaxi Formation shale is
dominated by meso-pores with a percentage of 83.1%, while
micro-pores and macro-pores accounts for much smaller
proportions, i.e., 6.5% and 10.4%, respectively. Meso-pores also
take an overwhelming dominance in pore SSA with a proportion
of 79.3%. Besides, the contribution of micro-pores to the pore
SSA should not be discounted with a proportion of 20.1%. In
contrast, macro-pores have least contribution to SSA with a
proportion of 0.5% only.
(4) TOC is the major factor controlling the development of
nanopores in the Longmaxi Formation shale. Different types
of pores have different characteristics in the gas occurrence
state and migration mode. The intraparticle pores and organic
pores provide space for the occurrence of adsorbed natural gas,
where gas migrates mainly by diffusion. Interparticle pores
and microfractures are ideal places for the accumulation of free
natural gas, where gas migrates by seepage-diffusion. Nanopores can provide favorable conditions for the micro-migration
and the occurrence of gas in shales.
