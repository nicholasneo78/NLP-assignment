Abstract: To evaluate the accumulation conditions and gas-bearing properties of shale gas in the
Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation, northwestern Hunan Province, the first shale gas parameter
well (Well Changye-1) that takes the Niutitang Formation as the target horizon in the Hunan Province
was selected preferably and drilled, cumulatively revealing the thickest dark shale horizon of the
Niutitang Formation among the single-well drillings in China, with a true vertical thickness of
674.5m. Through analyzing the core samples in terms of organic geochemistry, rock mineralogy and
reservoir properties, the black shale horizons in the Niutitang Formation of Well Changye-1 have
high organic carbon content (average 3.9%), moderate maturity (equivalent Ro average 2.6%), high
brittle mineral content (quartz content average 50.1%), low clay mineral content (average 32.4%),
low porosity (1.7%) and low permeability (1.32×10-3mD), and well-developed meso to micro-pores
and fractures, indicating good conditions for shale gas accumulation. Field desorption and laboratory
isothermal adsorption measurements on core samples show that Well Changye-1 has good gasbearing properties, and gas content generally increases with depth. The black shale horizons at the
depth of 1100-1250m have an average organic carbon content up to 10.1%, total gas content of 0.52.1m3/t and 3.7-6.4m3/t, and this is the most favorable depth for shale gas development, indicating
that the Niutitang Formation has good a prospect for shale gas exploration. Due to huge sedimentary
thickness, the black shale in the middle-lower part of the Niutitang Formation should be given
priority for exploration.

1 Introduction
Sichuan Basin and its peripheral areas have good geological
conditions and resource potential for shale gas formation

(Zhang et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2010; Dong et
al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). However, there is still rare research
on northwestern Hunan neighbored with Sichuan Basin, also
belonging to the Middle-Upper Yangtze Plate. In Lower

Cambrian Niutitang Formation, black shale is developed widely
with large thickness and high abundance of organic matter
(Zhao et al., 2001; Nie et al., 2009; Nie et al., 2011; Xiao et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2013). Thus northwestern Hunan is regarded
as the key breakthrough area for exploring the shale gas of
Niutitang Formation in southern China. Accordingly, based on
field geological investigation, the first shale gas parameter well
(Well Changye 1) that takes Niutitang Formation as the target
horizon in Hunan Province was selected and drilled. Through
dense sampling, test and analysis, on-site desorption and other
methods, this study systematically investigates the relevant
indicators of black shale gas content in the Niutitang Formation
of Well Changye 1, and quantitatively analyze the shale gas
accumulation conditions and gas-bearing characteristics in the
Niutitang Formation, thus providing an important parameter
basis for evaluating the regional shale gas resource potential of
northwestern Hunan.

2 Geological background
Geologically the northwestern Hunan area belongs to the
Middle-Upper Yangtze Plate. From Sinian to Early Paleozoic,
the area was part of a craton marine basin with a series of
sedimentary marine strata (Ma et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2007).
At the beginning of the Triassic, the basin experienced tectonic
inversion due to regional tectonic evolution, forming a series of
thrust nappe structures and para-foreland basins. The current
NNE and NE trending fold and fracture system were mainly
developed during the Jurassic and the Himalayan Orogeny
(BGMRHP, 1988), and the topography is mostly shown as
overlapping ridges and peaks, and as well as deep valleys (Fig. 1).
Among the Early Paleozoic sedimentary marine strata in the
northwestern Hunan area, the Lower Cambrian Niutitang
Formation is dominated by black shale, carbonaceous shale

and siliceous black shale, classified as deep shelf or bathyalabyssal sediments, and widely distributed with deep burial and
great sedimentary thickness. It is the main set of hydrocarbon
generation horizons in the Middle-Upper Yangtze Plate (Wang,
1985; Guo et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2002).

3 Sampling and measurements
To investigate the shale gas resource potential in the Lower
Cambrian Niutitang Formation in the northwestern Hunan
area, through field geological survey, a favorable drilling area
was selected for Well Changye-1, i.e., the west wing of the
Taiyangshan anticline with a bathyal-abyssal paleo-geographic
environment, flat terrain and no large faults on the surface.

shale (Schmoker, 1981; Jarvie et al., 2003; Bowker, 2007). The
changes of organic carbon content in a stratigraphic profile
can thus largely reflect the variations of shale gas content.
Cluster sampling was carried out on the black shale interval of
the Niutitang Formation in Well Changye-1 (with a sampling
interval of about 1m). In total, 584 experimental samples were
analyzed using a carbon and sulfur analysis. The analytical
results show that the total organic carbon (TOC) is 0.03%17.60%, with an average of 3.9%. The highest TOC is 17.60% at
the depth of 1130.0m.
In Well Changye-1, TOC content increases with depth. It begins
to increase significantly at the depth of 1100m. In the intervals
of 1103-1224m and 1288-1344m, the average TOC is 10.1%
and 8.2%, respectively, far greater than the defined threshold
for shale gas commercial development. When compared with
marine shales in the United States and its neighboring areas in
the Sichuan Basin, the black shale provides an excellent material
base for hydrocarbon generation (Table 2).

During the drilling of Well Changye-1, after the initial 17.5 m of
the Quaternary sediments, the Lower Cambrian Tanxi Formation
was encountered (with the main lithology of grey thin-layer finegrain dolomite, interlayered with a small number of dark gray
banded argillaceous limestone), and followed by the Lower
Cambrian Qingxudong Formation at the depth of 300.2m (with
the main lithology of dark grey thin-layer marl and dark gray
banded argillaceous limestone). The Niutitang Formation was
encountered at the depth of 535.5m. After the interbedding layer
of calcareous and carbonaceous shale was drilled at the upper
part, fine-grain limestone was encountered at the depth of 684.8m,
which was followed by the middle-lower part of the Niutitang
Formation, consisting mainly of black shale, carbonaceous
shale and siliceous shale at the depth of 742m. The bottom
of this formation was at the depth of 1344.1m. The well was
completed in the Sinian siliceous rocks at the depth of 1377.7m.
Well Changye-1 revealed the thickest black shale horizons of the
Niutitang Formation among the single-well drillings in China,
with the true vertical thickness of 674.5m.

The solid bitumen reflectance (Rb) of 30 samples was measured
by using organic maceral analysis method, and they were
converted to the equivalent vitrinite reflectance (equivalent Ro)
according to the empirical formula proposed by Feng (R o =
0.6569 Rb + 0.3364) (Feng and Chen, 1988). The organic matters
of more than half of the samples have been carbonized, unable to
provide morphological organic matter and maturity information.
For those samples from the depth interval of 1103-1224m with
maximum TOC, organic matter maturity (Ro equivalent) are
measured in the range of 2.02%-3.13% with an average value of
2.6%, consistent with the analytical results of regional outcrop
samples (Ro equivalent of 2.10%-3.24%, averaged at 2.8%).

To analyze the gas accumulation conditions and gas-bearing
characteristics of the black shale horizon (535.5-1344.1m)
in the Niutitang Formation of Well Changye-1, a total of 30
samples were collected from the black shale. Measurements on
the organic carbon content, organic matter maturity, mineral
composition, reservoir physical properties, pore size and specific
surface area were carried out according to the international
relatively general technical index (Wu et al., 2011). In
addition, laboratory isothermal adsorption and field desorption
measurements were also conducted. Sampling intervals were
appropriately increased or decreased depending on the need
(Table 1).

In the main shale gas production areas in North America, the
marine shale maturity is 0.4%-4.0%. This is particular the case
in the Upper Devonian shale in Appalachia Basin where the
maturity is generally greater than 1.3%, and some are up to
4.0%. In the northwestern Guizhou and southeastern Chongqing
regions, the black shale in the Niutitang Formation has an
average organic matter maturity of 2.7%, comparable with that
of Well Changye-1. The shale gas can only be produced in the
areas with high maturity (Milici and Swezey, 2006; Pollastro
et al., 2007). Due to the high maturity of the Lower Palaeozoic
marine shales in southern China, the maturity of Well
Changye-1 was relatively moderate.

Quartz content is generally increased with depth and the lithology
is gradually changes from black shale and carbonaceous shale to
siliceous shale and the Sinian siliceous rocks at the bottom of the
Niutitang Formation. Reservoirs with high contents of siliceous
shale can produce more natural fractures under tectonic stress,
which are favorable for storage of shale gas (Li et al., 2007; Chen et
al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). Effective tectonic or induced alteration
of shale reservoirs to certain extent may be beneficial to shale
gas exploitation. Effective alteration of gas shale requires enough
brittle minerals in favour of fractures (Wang et al., 2012; Yuan et
al., 2013). Based on the successful experience in exploring shale
gas in China and overseas, the brittle mineral content required for
effective extraction is generally greater than 40%. In the black shale
interval of Well Changye-1, the average brittle mineral (primarily
quartz) content accounts for 55.4% with the maximum of 80.2%.
The brittle mineral content shows an obvious increase over the
interval below 1100m, indicating good reservoir alterability.

4.4 Reservoir physical properties
In Well Changye-1, the porosity and permeability of seven
samples show very low effective porosities of 1.2%-1.9%
(averaged at 1.6%) and permeabilities of 0.01×10 -3 -3.75×10 3
mD (averaged at 1.32×10-3mD). In contrast, for the black shale
and carbonaceous shale in the interval of 1056.3-1258.7m, the
porosity is relatively large, but still no more than 2.0%.

4.5 Pore characteristics
The pore structures of 19 samples were measured using
mercury injection method in combination with specific surface
measurement. Analytical results show that in the Niutitang
Formation of Well Changye-1, the micro-pore volume is 0.02×
10 -3-0.91×10 -3mL/g (averaged at 0.3×10 -3mL/g); the meso-pore
volume is 1.03×10-3mL/g-15.19×10-3mL/g (averaged at 4.2×10-3 mL/g);
and the macro-pore volume is 0.01×10-3mL/g-1.60×10-3mL/g(averaged
at 0.5×10 -3mL/g). The total pore volume is 1.3×10 -3mL/g-16.1×
10-3mL/g (averaged at 5.1×10-3mL/g). The BET specific surface area
is 0.80-10.88m2/g (averaged at 3.1m2/g). The pore diameters range
from 4.54nm to 13.09nm with an average of 7.2nm. The shale from
the interval of 1100-1250m has the largest total pore volumes and
specific surface areas.
Tight shale also exists in the major shale gas producing basins
of eastern United States. Shale gas production rate is directly
related to the degree and characteristics of shale pore volumes
and structures. The nano-scale micro pores are able to increase
the specific surface area of the gas shale, and thus allow the
adsorption of more gas (Curtis, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2005; Ji
et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). Among the pores
of the black shale in Well Changye-1, the micro-meso pores with

sizes less than 50 nm appear to have the largest contribution to
the total pore volume, averagely accounting for 88.2% of the total
pore volume (Fig. 2). The average pore diameter is 7.2nm. Under
the premise of similar porosity, shales consisting predominantly
meso-micro pores can result in large specific surface areas, and
thus provide favorable conditions for adsorbing more gas.

calcite, dolomite and pyrite are 5.4%, 2.1%, 3.3% and 4.7%,
respectively. Some samples also contain minor siderites.

4.6 Fracture development
Fractures play an important role in reservoir reconstruction
(Curtis, 2002; Horsfield and Schulz, 2012). In Well Changye-1,
the core of the black shale is disintegrated in the Lower Cambrian
Niutitang Formation, and the disintegration of core is most serious
in the mid-lower part of this well (Fig. 3a). Moreover, fractures are
well developed, including extensional fractures, shear fractures
and compressional fractures (Fig. 3b). The well developed
structural fractures show that the black shale in the Niutitang
Formation is greatly influenced by structural deformation, which
is favorable to develop natural fractures for storage of free gas.

5 Shale gas-bearing characteristics
5.1 Field desorbed gas content
In this study, field desorption measurement was carried out on
63 samples, and no gas was desorbed from a part of samples in
the experimental process. According to the analytical results
of the desorbed gas and residual gas contents, the non-linear
regression method was used to calculate the gas loss volume,
so as to obtain the total gas content (Table 3). It is an accurate
method that can maximally reduce the error caused by escaping
gases (Tang et al., 2011).
According to the standard practice of shale gas exploration and
development in China, the commercial development of shale

gas will be viable only when the lower limit of the adsorbed gas
content is 0.5m3/t (Zhang et al., 2012). In Well Changye-1, in
the shallow intervals (less than 950m), the adsorbed gas content
is generally low, and some samples yielded no desorbed gas,
indicating no commercial development value. The desorbed gas
content increases gradually with depth. The black shale at the
depth of 956-989m has a relatively high adsorbed gas content
of 0.50-0.63m 3/t and an organic-rich shale thickness of 33m.
This interval has reached the lower limit of gas content for
commercial development. The black shale and carbonaceous
shale at the depth of 1067-1250m have a maximum gas content
of 0.50-2.1m3/t with a thickness of up to 183m. Therefore this
interval has a good commercial development value.

5.2 Gas isothermal adsorption capability
To evaluate the gas adsorption capacity of the black shale, 14
samples were selected for isothermal adsorption experiment.
Eight equilibrium pressure points were measured, i.e., 0MPa,
0.35MPa, 1.07MPa, 2.25MPa, 4.31MPa, 6.24MPa, 8.72MPa
and 11.13MPa. It took about 12h for each pressure point to reach

210

equilibrium and then the pressure was increased to the next
designated value. The results were fitted with the Langmuir
Equation to form isothermal adsorption curve and further
calculate the saturated gas adsorption volume. The results show
that the saturated gas adsorption volumes of samples are in the
range of 0.69-7.61m3/t with an average value of 2.79m3/t (Table 2);
the Langmuir pressure constants are in the range of 1.04-3.29MPa
with an average of 2.19MPa. All 14 samples have saturated gas
adsorption volumes greater than 0.5m3/t, including 6 samples with
the saturated gas adsorption volumes greater than 3m3/t. In the
interval of 1056-1320m, the isothermally adsorbed gas volume is
3.7-6.4m3/t, with the largest methane adsorption volume.

5.3 Favorable gas-bearing horizons
The most favorable interval for shale gas accumulation in well
Changy-1 is at the depth of 1100-1250m. In this interval, the black
shale has very high organic carbon content, medium maturity as
well as the maximum volume of micro, meso and macro-pores,
total pore volumes and specific surface areas. The quartz content
is relatively high, advantageous to reservoir fracturing; clay

Comprehensive analysis of gas-bearing characteristics for the black shale in the Niutitang Formation of
Well Changye-1

mineral content is moderate; the field desorbed gas content and
isothermally adsorbed gas content are also maximal. Therefore,
this interval is the most favorable for shale gas development in
Well Changye-1 (Fig. 4).

6 Conclusions
(1) It is revealed that the black shale horizon in the Niutitang
Formation of Well Changye-1 has a true vertical thickness of
674.5m, which is the thickest black shale interval among the
single-well drillings in China.
(2) In Well Changye-1, the black shale of the Niutitang
Formation is characterized by large thickness, high organic
ca rbon content (averaged at 3.9%), moderate matur ity
(equivalent Ro averaged at 2.6%), high brittle mineral content
(average quartz content of 50.1%), low content of clay minerals
(averaged at 32.4%), low porosity and permeability (averaged
at 1.7% and 1.32×10 -3mD, respectively). It is also featured by
the development of meso-micro pores and fractures. Well
Changye-1 has good accumulation conditions for shale gas.
(3) The Niutitang Formation in Well Changye-1 has good gas-

bearing properties. Generally, the gas content increases with
the depth. In the interval of 1100-1250m, the average organic
carbon content of black shale is up to 10.1%; the total content
of field desorbed gas is 0.5-2.1m3/t; the isothermally adsorbed
gas content is 3.7-6.4m3/t. Therefore, this interval is the most
favorable unit for shale gas development.
(4) The Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation is widely
distributed in the northwestern Hunan area as an marine shale.
The analysis results indicate the Niutitang Formation in Well
Changye-1 has a good shale gas exploration potential, further
confirming that the northwestern Hunan has a good development
prospect for shale gas resource.
