Tetraethyl lead (TEL), which is a common additive to the Iraqi pool gasoline,
is usually classified- among the most toxic selective additive even when it is added
at low doses (~ 1.5-2.0 %v/v). The present work was devoted to prepare and
investigate the effect of phenyl tert-butyl ether as an alternative selective additive to
the Iraqi pool gasoline produced in Doura Refinary-Midland Refineries Co.
Comparing with other additives-except TEL-, it was found that phenyl tert-butyl
ether increased RON of Doura pool gasoline by (5.7 to 10%) at a dose of 5%v/v
and it increased RON by (4.5 to 11.9%) at a dose of 8%v/v. Moreover, it appears to
have no adverse human health effects which make the suggested additive promising
for increasing the anti-knocking characteristic of Iraqi gasoline.
Keywords: Antiknock, Iraqi gasoline, additives, octane number.

Introduction:
Since World War II, gasoline, as a main fuel for personal vehicles, becomes
one of the most important resources in the world. In the early of 20th century,
automotive engineers discovered that engines with no knock would operate
smoother and more efficient. In 1916, Thomas Midgely a research scientist working
for the Dayton Research Laboratories of Dayton Ohio, discovered that the addition
of iodine to gasoline substantially reduced engine knocks. In a joint research work
in 1917, Charles Kettering (inventor of electric self-starter) and Thomas Midgley
blended ethyl alcohol (grain alcohol) with gasoline and concluded that alcohols
mixed with gasoline could produce a suitable motor fuel. Manufacturing of tetra
ethyl lead (TEL) began in 1923 with small operation in Dayton, Ohio that produced
about 600L of TEL per day. One liter of TEL was enough to treat 1150 liter of
gasoline [1]. Around the time of TEL production, William Mansfield Clark, a
laboratory director in the United States Public Health Service (USPHS), warned of
widespread use of TEL usage in gasoline. He stated that each liter of gasoline
burned would emit 1 g of lead oxide that would build up to dangerous level along
heavily traveled roads. Such a poor decision at that time did not allow a
comprehensive understanding of the real dangers posed by TEL and lack of
scientific research and evidence allowed the use of TEL for a few decades after its
discovery. The use of leaded gasoline for highway vehicles was banned in the
United States as of January 1, 1996 [2]. The comprehensive national Health and
Nutrition Examination survey by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention
confirmed that the average blood lead levels in the United States decreased from 16
mg dl-1 to 3 mg dl-1 from 1976 to 1990 respectively. This is the period when the use
E 11

Journal of Petroleum Research & Studies
of leaded gasoline fell from its peak to near zero in the United States [2].
Widespread use of oxygenates in gasoline dates to 1979, when methyl tert-butyl
ether (MTBE) was added to gasoline to substitute TEL and to increase the octane
rating of the fuel. As part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and through
an intensive negotiation between the USEPA, state officials, oil and automobile
industry representatives, gasoline retailers, oxygenate suppliers, environmental
organizations, and consumer groups, the federal government introduce the
reformulated gasoline (RFG) program in two phases into United States most
polluted cities. Both phases of the program require that RFG contain 2% by weight
oxygen. This program was aimed at reducing the level of highly toxic aromatics
(such as benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes) from gasoline and increasing
the oxygen content of gasoline by adding larger quantities of oxygenates. Addition
of oxygen to gasoline had a two-fold objective, to enhance the octane rating of
internal combustion engines and to reduce air pollution (summer time smog, winter
time carbon monoxide, and year-round air toxics) with provision of more complete
fuel combustion in the engines [3]. The addition of oxygenates to gasoline offers
many advantages, among which: more complete combustion and reduction of
carbon monoxide emission, being a renewable energy source, increased octane
number, and increased volatility [4]. Octane rating or octane number is a standard
measure of the performance of a motor or aviation fuel. The higher the octane
number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating. In broad
terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high-compression engines that
generally have higher performance. The most common type of octane rating
worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running
the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled
conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and nheptane. There is another type of octane rating called Motor Octane Number
(MON), or the aviation lean octane rating, which is a better measure of how the fuel
behaves when under load, as it is determined at 900 rpm engine speed, instead of
E 12

Journal of Petroleum Research & Studies
the 600 rpm for RON [5]. Figure (1) depicts RON of families of pure hydrocarbons
as function of their boiling points. Three of the more common oxygenated fuel
additives that have been used with unleaded gasoline are methanol, ethanol, and
methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE). Methanol is obtained from petroleum (from
methane or by reacting carbon monoxide and water); ethanol is obtained from corn
by fermentation; and MTBE is made synthetically from petroleum feed stocks. The
choice of which of the compounds commonly used in oxygenated fuels to use is
dependent on region, cost of production, and availability of raw materials, table (1)
shows properties of some gasoline active additives. The Table depicts the
dependency of RON on %O2 of the active additive.

Toxicity or "hazard" of gasoline of interest to those reading a toxicity profile varies
tremendously with the exact gasoline in question. Table (2) shows the exposure
limits of some active additives. It indicates that the most hazardous materials are
Benzene and TEL. The object of this study is to provide a method of preparing a
selective additive, which is an environmental friendly additive, and blending with
gasoline pool produced in Al Doura Refinery to enhancing the octane number.
Other objects will be apparent to that who skilled-in-the-arts.
Theoretical Aspects
MON Correlation
Once clear RON is known, clear MON can be estimated from the following
correlation derived from the correlation proposed by [9] for olefin free fuels.
MON 22.5, 0.83 RON 20.0 SG………………………………………. (1)
Blended Values
The blended value of an active additive is calculated by adding it to the RON of the
gasoline which is to be treated, the change in RON is calculated by dividing the
volume% of additive added. The Blending Value is a measure of affectivity of an
additive [10].

Octane Number Sensitivity
Fuels with lower sensitivity are desirable. Because the two test methods use
different test conditions, especially the intake mixture temperatures and engine
speeds, fuel that is sensitive to changes in operating conditions will have a larger
difference between the two rating methods. Modern fuels typically have
sensitivities around 10. Equation 3 was used to estimate octane number sensitivity
[11].

Iraqi Pool Gasoline
Gasoline Pool Production in Al Doura Refinery
Two units operated in Al Doura Refinery to improve octane number of gasoline,
one is called Reformer unit, the feed for this unit is a mixture of 30%LSRN and
70% HSRN, and the product is Reformate. The other unit is Power Former, feed is
HSRN and the product is Power Formate. Gasoline production in Al Doura
Refinery included many streams such as :
•LSRN (RON =69.2).
•Reformate (RON= 90.5) (from Reforming a mixture of 30%LSRN and
70%HSRN).
•Power Formate (RON=89.3) (from Reforming HSRN).
All feeds and products of Reformer and Power Former units were tested by ASTM
standards and IROX analyzer. Table (3) shows Octane number of petroleum cuts,
pool, and leaded gasoline of Al Doura Refinery by ZX-101C (Zeltex, Inc.,

RON of blended gasoline is shown in table (5). As expected none of the alcohols
achieve the target specification. Isopropanol at 10% is the best at approaching RON
≈90. However, for Isopropanol at 10%, the RVP value is well over the 60 kPa target
and even exceeds 60 kPa at 5%. At 10% Isopropanol l, oxygen is well over the
2.7% limit but the heating value of the fuel is only marginally less than the base
stock. Using alcohols, sensitivity declines slightly and none of the alcohols achieve
the 85 MON target.

* Preparation of the selective additives
As it is known to that skilled in-the-art, the octane number of gasoline may be
increased by the addition of various aliphatic ethers which have no environmental
impact. The phenyl-t-butyl ether which may be used an octane appreciator of the
process of this study may not readily available; therefore, it is prepared as here
under.
Experimental set-upFigure (2) represents a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus that used to
prepare phenyl-t-butyl ether.
A three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a reflux
condenser, and a 500-ml of what. Pressure-equalized dropping funnel is arranged
for conducting a reaction in an atmosphere of nitrogen by fitting into the top of the
condenser a T-tube attached to a low-pressure supply of nitrogen and to a mercury
bubbler.

Method of PreparationThe detail of the preparation method of phenyl t-butyl ether (PTBE) is found
elsewhere [14].The flask is dried by warming it with a soft flame as a slow stream
of nitrogen is passed through the system. In the cooled flask a solution of
phenylmagnesiumbromide is prepared from 13 g. (0.53 g. atoms) of magnesium
turnings, 79 g. (0.5 moles, 53.6 ml.) of bromobenzene, and 200 ml. of anhydrous
ether. After the preparation of phenylmagnesium bromide is complete, the ethereal
solution is cooled in an ice bath and 200 ml. of anhydrous ether is added. A solution
of 58.3 g. (0.3 mole, 56 ml.) of t-butyl perbenzoate in 120 ml.

is added, dropwise, with stirring over a 30-minute period, and the stirring is
continued for an additional 5 minutes. The reaction mixture is poured carefully into
a cold solution of 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1:1 of water. The
ethereal layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 150-ml.
portions of ether. The combined organic layers are extracted with three 25-ml.
portions of 2Msodium hydroxide solution, washed with water until the washings are
neutral, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The dried solution is
concentrated and the product distilled under reduced pressure, B.P. 58–
60°C/8.6mm. The yield of phenyl t-butyl ether is 34–36 g. (76–81%).

To identify the functional groups in the prepared additive, an analysis was carried
out using FTIR- Type TENSOR 27 from BRUKER. Figure (3) illustrates such
identification-before distillation step. The plot depicts several absorptions in the
fingerprint region. The most prominent band is C-H stretch 1300-1000 cm-1phenyl
alkyl ethers which gives two strong bands at about 1158.20 to 1233.68cm-1[15].

Conclusion:
The present work is devoted to prepare and examine a novel fuel additive as an
alternative to the most toxic additive that used to improve antiknock characteristics
of gasoline produced in Iraqi Refineries.
From the results of the present study, one may conclude the following:
 The prepared material (i. e., phenyl t-butyl ether) increases RON of gasoline
pool from 4.5 to 11.9% which is more than does any other oxygenators
literary scanned in the present work- except TEL-.
 It appears that this additive has no effects to human health which makes it a
candidate additive.
