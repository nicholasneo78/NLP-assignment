Foreword

Petroleum has remained an important aspect of our lives and will do
so for the next four or five decades. The fuels that are derived from
petroleum supply more than half of the world’s total supply of energy.
Gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil provide fuel for automobiles, tractors,
trucks, aircraft, and ships. Fuel oil and natural gas are used to heat homes and
commercial buildings, as well as to generate electricity. Petroleum products
are the basic materials used for the manufacture of synthetic fibers for
clothing and in plastics, paints, fertilizers, insecticides, soaps, and synthetic
rubber. The uses of petroleum as a source of raw material in manufacturing
are central to the functioning of modern industry.
Petroleum refining is now in a significant transition period as the
industry has moved into the 21st century and the demand for petroleum
products has shown a sharp growth in recent years, especially with the recent
entry of China into the automobile market. This means that the demand
transportation fuels will, without doubt, show a steady growth in the next
decade, contributing to petroleum product demand patterns that can only be
fulfilled by the inclusion of heavier feedstocks into refinery operations.
In fact, the increasing supply of heavy crude oils as refinery
feedstocks is a serious matter and it is essential that refineries are able to
accommodate these heavy feedstocks. Indeed, in order to satisfy the changing
pattern of product demand, significant investments in refining conversion
processes will be necessary to profitably utilize these heavy crude oils. The
most efficient and economical solution to this problem will depend to a large
extent on individual country and company situations. However, the most
promising technologies will likely involve the conversion of heavy crude oil,
vacuum bottom residua, asphalt from deasphalting processes, and bitumen
from tar sand deposits. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the benefits
and limitations of petroleum processing is necessary and is introduced within
the pages of this book.
The book is divided into two volumes. The first volume contains
covers the origin and characterization of petroleum, major processes for fuel-

Foreword

production, and environmental pollution control. The second volume focuses
on lubricants, hydrogen production, process modeling, automation, and online
optimization.
The 50 contributors hail from three continents – Asia, Europe, and
North America. This allows the book to contain within its pages a variety of
experiences that are truly worldwide in breadth and scope. Contributions
come from several sources, including integrated oil companies, catalyst
suppliers, licensors, consultants, and academic researchers.
I am pleased to have been asked to write the Forward to this book. In
light of the world energy situation, it is a necessary and timely addition to the
literature that covers the technology of petroleum.

Preface

In 1964, Bob Dylan released an album and song named, The Times They
Are A-Changin’. He was right. Times were changing, but nobody, not even
Dylan, could have foreseen just how dramatically the great, wide world – and
the smaller world of petroleum processing – would change during the next
forty years.
In 1964, a wall divided Berlin. The moon was free of foot-prints. And in
America we said, “Fill ‘er up with ethyl” as a team of fueling-station
attendants hurried to wash the windows of our thirsty Fords and Chevies.
In 1970, the Nixon administration created the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), which, in 1973, initiated a lead phase-down
program for gasoline. By the end of the decade, thanks to an oil embargo in
1973-74 and a revolution in Iran in 1978-79, fuel-efficient Japanese cars were
displacing home-made brands in the United States and Europe.
In the 1980s, refiners built new process units to close the “octane gap”
created by ever-tighter limits on lead in gasoline. Due to record-high prices,
the worldwide demand for petroleum actually was decreasing. The drive to
conserve energy created a market for rigorous models and advanced process
control in refineries and petrochemical plants.
The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 again changed the
industry. For gasoline, the CAAA required the addition of oxygenates such as
MTBE. Billions of dollars, francs, marks, and yen were spent building
methanol and MTBE plants. For on-road diesel, the CAAA emulated
California by limiting sulfur content to 500 wppm. Across the Atlantic, the
European Commission imposed a different set of limits. By the end of 2003,
refiners were making low-sulfur gasoline and preparing to make ultra-lowsulfur diesel. Ironically, in 1999, Governor Gray Davis issued an executive
order banning the use of MTBE in California gasoline. Soon thereafter, Davis
was replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Purpose of this Book. This historical digression illustrates, we hope, that
petroleum processing is a dynamic industry driven by global political,
economic, and environmental forces. That’s one of the reasons we’re writing
this book: to explain how the industry has changed during the past 40 years,

particularly since 1994. We also wanted to cover cutting-edge topics usually
missing from other general books on refining – FCC gasoline post-treatment,
catalytic production of lubes, optimization of hydrogen and utility networks,
process modeling, model-predictive control, and online optimization. And in
addition: pollution control, staffing, reliability and safety.
Target Audience. Our target audience includes engineers, scientists and
students who want an update on petroleum processing. Non-technical readers,
with help from our extensive glossary, will benefit from reading Chapter 1
and the overview chapters that precede each major section.
Contributors. We are pleased to have contributions from several sources,
including integrated oil companies, catalyst suppliers, licensors, consultants,
and academic researchers. Our 50 contributors hail from three continents –
Asia, Europe, and North America.
Many of the chapters are based on presentations given at a symposium at
the 222nd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), which
was held in Chicago, Illinois in 2001. The symposium was entitled, “Kinetics
and Mechanisms of Petroleum Processes.” We thank ACS and the Division of
Petroleum Chemistry, Inc. for allowing us to co-chair that session.
Organization and Overview. The book is divided into two volumes. The
first contains 14 chapters, which cover the origin and characterization of
petroleum, major processes for fuel-production, and environmental pollution
control. The second volume contains 13 chapters, which focus on lubricants,
hydrogen production, process modeling, automation, and refining
management.
Chapter 1 introduces the book by giving an overview of petroleum and
petroleum processing. Chapters 2-4 focus on the origin and characterization of
oil and gas. Chapter 5 reports recent advances in the production of light olefin
feedstocks for petrochemicals by catalytic processes, especially the balance
between propylene and ethylene. Chapter 6 gives an overview of the kinetics
and mechanism of fluidized catalytic cracking, an important process for
producing gasoline.
The next five chapters discuss hydroprocessing and alternative ways to
remove sulfur from fuels. Chapter 7 gives an overview of hydrotreating and
hydrocracking and Chapter 8 gives more detail on hydrocracking. Chapters 911 discuss aspects of hydrotreating catalysts and processes, especially those
related to meeting clean fuel specifications. Chapter 12 describes an extractive
desulfurization process, and Chapter 13 discusses improvements in reactor
design for hydroprocessing units.
One of the most important elements in modern petroleum refining is to
keep the environment clean. Chapter 14 covers a wide range of pollution

Preface

control issues: regulations, types of pollutants, informative examples of major
environmental incidents, and pollution control technology.
The first four chapters in Volume 2 describe processes for making
lubricating oils, including synthetic lubes. Chapter 15 gives an overview of
conventional manufacturing processes for lube base-stocks, Chapter 16
discusses selective hydroprocessing for making high quality lubricants to
meet new standards, Chapter 17 discusses synthetic lube base stocks, and
Chapter 18 describes additives and formulation technology for engine oils.
As the world’s supplies of light crude oils dwindle, processes for refining
heavy oils and bitumen are becoming increasingly important. Chapter 19
deals with heavy oil processing. It reviews the chemical composition, physical
and chemical properties, and upgrading chemistry of bitumen and heavy oils.
During the past twenty years, competitive pressures, including industry
consolidation, forced the closure of some refineries even as others expanded.
More and more, surviving refiners are using automation – model-predictive
control, composition-based modeling, and computerized analysis of analytical
data – to gain or maintain a competitive edge. Chapter 20 describes the
application of kinetic modeling tools based on molecular composition to the
development of a mechanistic kinetic model for the catalytic hydrocracking of
heavy paraffins. Chapter 21 provides a general survey of process models
based on two types of kinetic lumping: partition-based lumping and total
lumping. Chapter 22 describes how model-predictive control can increase
throughput, product quality, and stability in refining operations. Chapter 23
describes the real-time, online refinery-wide optimization application at
Sunoco-Sarnia.
As refiners reconfigure their plants to produce clean fuels, they are looking
at ways to optimize the value of the hydrogen they now produce. They are
also looking at different ways to supply the extra hydrogen required to make
clean fuels. Chapter 24 discusses the online application of models of
hydrogen production from the steam reforming of naphtha and other
hydrocarbons. Chapter 25 addresses the issues of hydrogen demand,
production and supply in refineries, and Chapter 26 tells refiners why they
should think of their hydrogen as an asset, not a liability.
Chapter 27 reviews a new methodology to generate complete and reliable
crude oil assays from limited laboratory data. Better crude quality control can
improve refinery planning to ensure the profitability to survive in highly
competitive global markets. It has also potential to be used in upstream
operations for preliminary assessment of the oil quality of new reservoirs and
new wells.
Putting this book together has been a rewarding challenge. We hope that
you, our readers, will find it useful.

INTRODUCTION

The ground begins to rumble, then shake. The hero of the film – a lean excowboy with a square jaw under his hat and a gorgeous brunette on his arm –
reaches out to brace himself against his horse. A smile creases his face as the
rumbling grows louder. Suddenly, a gush of black goo spurts into the air and
splashes down on him, his side-kick and his best gal. They dance with ecstasy
until the music swells and the credits start to roll.
Why is our hero so happy? Because he’s rich! After years of drilling dry
holes in every county between the Red River and the Rio Grande, he finally
struck oil.

1.1

History of Petroleum Production

So why is he rich? What makes oil so valuable?
Actually, crude oil straight from the ground has some value, but not a lot.
Table 1 shows the history of petroleum before 1861. Before 1859, oil that was
mined or that simply seeped up out of the ground was used to water-proof
ships, as an adhesive in construction, for flaming projectiles, and in a wide
variety of ointments.1-4
After 1859, petroleum became more and more important to the world’s
economy, so important that today, without a steady flow of oil, most human
activities on this planet would grind to a halt. Petroleum accounts for 60% of
the world’s shipping on a tonnage basis.3 It provides fuels and lubricants for
our trucks, trains, airplanes, and automobiles. Ships are powered by fuel oil
derived from petroleum. Bottom-of-the-barrel petroleum derivatives pave our
roads and provide coke for the steel industry. Together with natural gas,

petroleum provides precursors for the world’s petrochemical industries. At
the end of 2003, the world was consuming 78 million barrels of oil per day.5
In August 2005, that volume of petroleum was worth $4.6 billion per day,
or $1.7 trillion per year.
Table 1. History of Petroleum Before 1861
Date
Description
3000 BC
Sumerians use asphalt as an adhesive for making mosaics.
Mesopotamians use bitumen to line water canals, seal boats, and build
roads. Egyptians use pitch to grease chariot wheels, and asphalt to
embalm mummies.
1500 BC
The Chinese use petroleum for lamps and for heating homes.
600 BC
Confucius writes about the drilling of 100-foot (30-meter) natural gas
wells in China. The Chinese build pipelines for oil using bamboo poles.
600-500 BC
Arab and Persian chemists mix petroleum with quicklime to make Greek
fire, the napalm of its day.
1200-1300 AD The Persians mine seep oil near Baku (now in Azerbaijan).
1500-1600 AD Seep oil from the Carpathian Mountains is used in Polish street lamps.
The Chinese dig oil wells more than 2000 feet (600 meters) deep.
1735 AD
Oil is extracted from oil sands in Alsace, France.
Early 1800s
Oil is produced in United States from brine wells in Pennsylvania.
1847
James Oakes builds a “rock oil” refinery in Jacksdale, England.6 The unit
processes 300 gallons per day to make “paraffin oil” for lamps. James
Young builds a coal-oil refinery in Whitburn, Scotland.7
1848
F.N. Semyenov drills the first “modern” oil well near Baku.
1849
Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner distills kerosene from crude oil.
1854
Ignacy Lukasiewicz drills oil wells up to 150 feet (50 meters) deep at
Bóbrka, Poland.
1857
Michael Dietz invents a flat-wick kerosene lamp (Patent issued in 1859).
1858
Ignacy Lukasiewicz builds a crude oil distillery in Ulaszowice, Poland.8

So what happened in 1859? What began the transformation of petroleum
from a convenience into the world’s primary source of energy? As often is the
case with major socioeconomic shifts, the move toward oil was instigated not
by just a single event, but by the juxtaposition of several:
• In the 1850s, most home-based lamps burned whale oil or other animal
fats. Historically, whale-oil prices had always fluctuated wildly, but they
peaked in the mid-1850s due to the over-hunting of whales; by some
estimates, in 1860 several species were almost extinct. Whale oil sold for
an average price of US$1.77 per gallon between 1845 and 1855. In
contrast, lard oil sold for about US$0.90 per gallon.9,10 Lard oil was more
abundant, but it burned with a smoky, smelly flame.

Michael Dietz invented a flat-wick kerosene lamp in 1857. The Dietz
lamp was arguably the most successful of several devices designed to
burn something other than animal fats.
The availability of kerosene got a sudden boost on August 27, 1859, when
Edwin L. Drake struck oil with the well he was drilling near Titusville,
Pennsylvania. By today’s standards, the well was shallow – about 69 feet
(21 meters) deep and it produced only 35 barrels per day. Drake was able
to sell the oil for US$20 per barrel, a little less than the price of lard oil
and 70% less than the price of whale oil. In 1861, US$700 per day was a
tidy sum, equivalent to US$5 million per year in 2002 dollars.11 Drake’s
oil well was not the first – according to one source, the Chinese beat
Drake by about 2200 years – but it may have been the first drilled through
rock, and it certainly triggered the Pennsylvania oil rush. Figure 1 shows
some of the closely spaced wells that sprang up in 1859 in the Pioneer
Run oil field a few miles from Titusville.

According to a report issued in 1860 by David Dale Owens,12 the state
geologist of Arkansas:
“On Oil Creek in the vicinity of Titusville, Pennsylvania, oil flows out
from some wells at the rate of 75 to 100 gallons in 24 hours already fit for the
market. At least 2000 wells are now in progress and 200 of these are already
pumping oil or have found it.”
According to The Prize,13 a prize-winning book by Daniel Yergin:

“When oil first started flowing out of the wells in western Pennsylvania in
the 1860’s, desperate oil men ransacked farmhouses, barns, cellars, stores, and
trash yards for any kind of barrel – molasses, beer, whiskey, cider, turpentine,
sale, fish, and whatever else was handy. But as coopers began to make barrels
especially for the oil trade, one standard size emerged, and that size continues
to be the norm to the present. It is 42 gallons.
“The number was borrowed from England, where a statute in 1482 under
King Edward IV established 42 gallons as the standard size barrel for herring
in order to end skullduggery and “divers deceits” in the packing of fish. At the
time, herring fishing was the biggest business in the North Sea. By 1866,
seven years after Colonel Drake drilled his well, Pennsylvania producers
confirmed the 42-gallon barrel as their standard, as opposed to, say, the 31½
gallon wine barrel or the 32 gallon London ale barrel or the 36 gallon London
beer barrel.”
In sharp contrast to the situation today, in 1870 America was the world’s
leading oil producer, and oil was America’s 2nd biggest export.4 Agricultural
products were first, accounting for 79% of exports that were worth, on
average, US$573 million per year from 1870 to 1879.14 Despite the ravages of
the U.S. Civil War, the main agricultural export was still “King Cotton.”

1.2

What Is Petroleum?

Before we go on to talk about petroleum processing, it is important to
know something about petroleum itself. Petroleum is called a fossil fuel
because it is formed from the bodies of ancient organisms – primarily onecelled plants and animals (see Chapter 2). Contrary to modern myth, only a
tiny fraction (if any) of the molecules in crude oil are from dinosaurs. When
these creatures died, their remains accumulated at bottoms of ancient lakes or
seas, along with sand and other sediments. Over time, a combination of
pressure, heat, and bacterial action transformed the deposits into sedimentary
rock. The incorporated organic matter was transformed into simpler
chemicals, such as hydrocarbons, water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide,
and others.
The chemicals didn’t always stay put. If the surrounding rock was porous,
liquids and gases could migrate, either up to the surface or into a reservoir
(Figure 2) that was capped by impermeable rock or a dome of salt. Today,
when petroleum geologists look for oil, they actually are looking for
structures that might be traps for liquid hydrocarbons.

In solid sources of fossil fuel – coal, oil shale, oil sands and tar sands – the
mineral content is higher and the hydrocarbon molecules usually are heavier.
In China and South Africa, a significant amount of coal is converted into
synthesis gas, which is used to make chemicals and/or synthetic petroleum. In
Canada, oil sands are converted into more than 700,000 barrels-per-day of
synthetic petroleum, which is sent to conventional oil refineries in Canada
and the United States. A well-written book by Berger and Anderson 15
provides additional general information about the formation, production, and
refining of petroleum.
Due to its origin, crude oil is a complex mixture containing thousands of
different hydrocarbons.16,17 As the name implies, hydrocarbons are chemicals
containing hydrogen and carbon. In addition to hydrogen and carbon, most
crude oils also contain 1 to 3 wt% sulfur along with smaller amounts of
nitrogen, oxygen, metals, and salts. The salts can be removed with a hot-water
wash (see Section 2), but the other major contaminants – sulfur, nitrogen,
oxygen and metals – are harder to remove because they are linked to
hydrocarbons by chemical bonds.
Crude oils from some wells are as clear as vegetable oil. Other wells
produce green, brown or black crudes. Some taste sour or smell like rotten
eggs. Some flow as easily as water, others don’t flow unless they are heated,
and some are so solid they have to be mined.
Table 2 compares properties for 21 selected crudes. Traders characterize a
crude by citing its source, API gravity (a measure of density), and sulfur
content. The source is the oil field from which the crude was produced. The
API gravity is a rough indication of distillation properties, which determine
how much gasoline, kerosene, etc., can be distilled from the crude. Along
with other factors, the sulfur content affects processing costs. Figure 3 shows

Robinson

that light crudes (those with high API gravities) often contain less sulfur and
nitrogen than heavy crudes, but not always.

The Chemicals in Petroleum

Carbon is present in almost all of the chemical compounds in petroleum. If
you’ve ever taken a chemistry class, you know that carbon, more than any
other element, binds to itself to form straight chains, branched chains, rings,
and complex three-dimensional structures. The most complex molecules are
biological – proteins, carbohydrates, fats and nucleic acids, which are present
in every living thing, from the smallest bacterium to the largest tree. This is
significant here because (as stated above) petroleum was formed from ancient
organisms, and its molecules retain certain structural characteristics of the
organic compounds from which it formed.
1.2.1.1

Paraffins

The lightest paraffin is methane (CH4) which is the major constituent of
natural gas. Paraffins have the general formula CnH2n+2. The carbon chains in
paraffins can be straight or branched. Compounds with the same formula but
different structures are called isomers. Straight-chain paraffins are “normal,”
while branched paraffins with the same chemical formula are called “iso.”

Tables 3 and 4 show that isomers have different physical properties.18
They also can have significantly different chemical properties. For gasoline,
one of the most important chemical properties is octane number. The research
octane number (RON) for n-octane is -27 compared to a RON of 100 (by
definition) for isooctane (2,2,3-trimethylpentane). For heptane isomers, RON
values range from 45 for 2-methyl-hexane to >100 for 2,2,3-trimethylbutane,
compared to zero (by definition) for n-heptane. Octane numbers are discussed
in more detail in Section 8.2.

The melting points of paraffin isomers also can differ significantly. As
shown in Table 5, long-chain n-paraffins melt at relatively high temperatures,
while their branched-chain isomers melt at lower temperatures. This explains
their different behaviours as lubricants. Long-chain normal paraffins are
waxy, so as lubricants they are terrible. Conversely, iso-paraffins with the
same number of carbons are excellent lube base stocks.

Aromatics and Naphthenes

Aromatics and naphthenes are also found in petroleum. Aromatics contain
one or more unsaturated 5 to 6-carbon rings. In naphthenes, carbon rings are
saturated with hydrogen.
Figure 5 shows structures for a few of the aromatics and naphthenes that
have been found in crude oils. For aromatics with one six-carbon ring, the
general formula is CnH2n-6, and for naphthenes with one ring, the general
formula is CnH2n.

Aromatics and naphthenes display significantly different chemical and
physical properties. Compared to paraffins and naphthenes with the same
carbon number, aromatics are denser and have higher octane numbers.
1.2.1.3

Hetero-atom Compounds

When present in organic compounds, atoms other than carbon and
hydrogen are called hetero-atoms. As mentioned above, sulfur, nitrogen,
oxygen and metals are minor constituents of crude oil, but as we shall see,
their impact on processing costs can be major. Figure 6 shows some of the
sulfur and nitrogen compounds that present problems to oil refiners. When
burned in vehicles or power plants, high-sulfur fuels cause acid rain. For
many refining processes, sulfur is a catalyst poison. Nitrogen and metals also
are catalyst poisons. Therefore, refiners devote a considerable amount of time
and money to remove hetero-atoms from intermediate streams and finished
products.
1.2.1.4

Olefins

We need to discuss one more class of molecules before moving on. Due to
their high reactivity, olefins are not common in natural crude oil. However, in
refineries they are generated by several “cracking“ processes. Figure 7 shows
structures for some common light olefins.

History of Petroleum Processing

These days, it’s extremely rare for oil to flow out of a well already fit for
the market as it did in the 1860s near Oil Creek, Pennsylvania.12 Crudes from
the Tapis field in Malaysia are almost good enough for direct use in diesel
engines, but even these high-quality “boutique crudes” are sent to refineries
for separation into higher-value components.
As mentioned in Section 1.1, in the 1860s the most valuable crude-oil
fraction was kerosene. From the first crude distillation units – which truly
were crude, comprising cast-iron kettles, water-cooled coils and wooden
product-collection vats – part of the lightest fraction (naphtha) was sold as a
solvent, but most of it was burned off. Distillates heavier than kerosene (gas
oils) found some use as lubricants, but the undistilled residues were discarded.
1.3.1

Demand for Conversion

The demand for petroleum remained relatively flat throughout the last half
of the 19th Century. In 1878, thanks to the inventions of Thomas Edison,
electric lighting slowly but surely began to displace kerosene as a preferred
illuminant. (Table 5)
But the biggest blow to kerosene came from the gasoline-powered
automobile. Developed in 1889 by Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and
(separately) by Karl Benz, the motor car was a curiosity until 1901, when
Ransom Eli Olds started assembly-line production of the Curved Dash
Oldsmobile Runabout.19
Henry Ford built his first gasoline-powered car in 1896 and founded the
Ford Motor Company in 1903. In 1908 he began selling Model T’ s for the
low, low price of US$950. The resulting boom in automobile sales triggered
tremendous growth in petroleum demand, which continued unabated until the
Arab Oil Embargo of 1973. Over 15 million Model T Fords were sold in the
United States alone between 1908 and 1917, with prices as low as US$280
per unit.19
In addition to increasing the overall demand for petroleum, the advent of
the automobile increased the relative demand for naphtha (from which
gasoline is derived) versus kerosene. In response, refiners developed
conversion processes. The first of these was the thermal cracking process
patented by William Burton and Robert Humphreys, who were working for
Standard Oil of Indiana. The Burton-Humphreys process doubled the yield of
gasoline from crude oil, and it is credited for averting a gasoline shortage
during World War I. Moreover, gasoline from thermal crackers performed
better in automobiles than straight-run products distilled from crude
petroleum.

In 1914, Jesse A. Dubbs and J. Ogden Armour founded the National
Hydrocarbon Company, which later became Universal Oil Products (UOP).20
UOP grew to become the world’s largest licensor of process technology for
the oil refining industry. In 1919, UOP commercialized the Dubbs process,
which solved some of the problems associated with the Burton-Humphreys
process. The Dubbs process produced fewer coke deposits, it could process
heavier petroleum fractions, and it ran longer between shutdowns.
Standard Oil of Indiana commercialized the delayed coking process at
Whiting, Indiana in 1929. In 1933, UOP commercialized the conversion of
olefins to gasoline via catalytic polymerization. Later in the 1930s, refiners
began using tetraethyl lead to boost the octane of gasoline. A consortium of

Petroleum Processing Overview

13

refining companies – Anglo-Iranian, Humble, Shell Oil, Standard Oil, and
Texaco – developed sulfuric acid alkylation, which was commercialized in
1938 at the Humble (now ExxonMobil) refinery in Baytown, Texas. In 1940,
Phillips Petroleum (now ConocoPhillips) developed HF alkylation.
Eugene Houdry patented the Houdry Catalytic Cracking (HCC) process in
1934. HCC was commercialized in 1937. With amazing foresight, Houdry
also invented the catalytic converter, which started appearing on automobiles
in the 1970s.
In 1942, Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil) commercialized
the fluided catalytic cracking (FCC) process, which dramatically increased a
refiner’s ability to convert heavy gas oils into gasoline. The four inventors of
this process, which still produces more than half of the world’s gasoline, were
Donald L. Campbell, Homer Z. Martin, Eger V. Murphree, and Charles W.
Tyson. During 1942-45, several FCC-based refineries were built in the United
States to produce automotive and aviation gasoline during World War II.
After 1945, the development of new refining processes was stimulated by
a continuing increase in demand for petroleum products, coupled with the
increased availability of oil from the Middle East and elsewhere. The quality
of gasoline got a large boost from catalytic reforming, which first appeared in
1949 at the Old Dutch refinery in Muskegon, Michigan. The unit was based
on technology developed by UOP, which employed a platinum-based catalyst
invented by Vladimir N. Ipatieff.
In 1961, hydrocracking was introduced to convert gas oil into naphthenerich heavy naphtha, which is a superb feed for a catalytic reformer. The first
unit used the Isocracking process developed by Standard Oil of California
(now Chevron Texaco).
1.3.2

Demand for a Clean Environment

In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon established the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Congress passed the Clean Air Act
(CAA). The CAA required a 90% reduction in auto emissions by 1975. The
scope and timing of this requirement presented a challenge to the automobile
industry.21 After reviewing several alternatives, auto makers focused on
developing catalytic converters to remove carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons
from automobile exhaust. Also in 1970, the European Union issued directive
70/220/EEC, which specified similar emission limits for passenger cars.
Lead poisons the active metal (platinum) in catalytic converters, so in
1975 EPA promulgated a phase-out plan to remove lead from gasoline.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the
U.S. EPA and the European Commission promulgated requirements for
reformulated gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, low-sulfur gasoline and ultra-lowsulfur diesel (ULSD). ULSD will enable the use of advanced emission

controls (including catalytic converters) on diesel-powered cars and trucks.
Refiners are responding by installing additional hydrotreating capacity.

Modern Petroleum Processing

All refineries are different. They have different histories, locations, and
market drivers. Therefore, no single illustration can capture all of the possible
combinations and permutations of the processes that fit together to comprise
an oil refinery. But despite their differences, most refineries perform the seven
basic operations named in Table 6.

recovery units, but these are almost always present. Lube-oil processing and
hydrogen production units also may be present.
The depicted plant is configured for maximum fuels production. In a
typical European refinery, the coker would be replaced with a visbreaker. In
many Asian refineries, where diesel demand is higher than gasoline demand,
the coker would be replaced by a visbreaker and the FCC by a hydrocacker.
The rest of this chapter provides a brief overview of the processes shown
or mentioned above. The chapters that follow provide detailed process
descriptions, with emphasis on recent developments. General information on
refining technology can be found in the excellent books by E.I. Shaheen,22
and W.L. Leffler,23 and in a manual published by the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.24 Each year, Hydrocarbon Processing
compiles a widely read refining process handbook, which gives descriptions
of about 120 licensed processes offered by engineering contractors, oil
companies, and of course process licensors.25

Distillation

In terms of throughput, the biggest unit in most plants is the crude
distillation unit (Figure 9). Many downstream conversion units also use
distillation for production separation. For example, in a coker, hydrocracker,
or FCC unit, an atmospheric tower, a vacuum tower, and a multi-column gas
plant may be required.
2.1.1

Atmospheric Distillation

Crude oil distillation is more complicated than product distillation, in part
because crude oils contain water, salts, and suspended solids. To reduce
corrosion, plugging, and fouling in crude heaters and towers, and to prevent
the poisoning of catalysts in downstream units, these contaminants are
removed by a process called desalting.
The two most typical methods of crude-oil desalting – chemical and
electrostatic separation – use hot water to dissolve the salts and collect

Robinson

suspended solids. In chemical desalting, water and surfactants are added to the
crude, heated to dissolve salts and other impurities, and then sent to a settling
tank where the water and oil separate. In electrostatic desalting, chemicals are
replaced with a strong electrostatic charge, which drives the separation of
water from oil.

Figure 9. Crude distillation

Modern crude distillation towers can process 200,000 barrels of oil per
day. They can be up to 150 feet (50 meters) tall and contain 20 to 40
fractionation trays spaced at regular intervals. In some towers, the trays in the
top section are replaced with structured packing.
Before reaching the tower, desalted oil goes through a network of pre-heat
exchangers to a fired heater, which brings the temperature up to about 650°F
(343°C). If the oil gets much hotter that this, it starts to crack and deposit
carbon inside the pipes and equipment through which it flows. The hot crude
enters the distillation tower just above the bottom. Steam is added to enhance
separation; it does so largely by decreasing vapor pressure in the column.
When hot oil enters the tower, most of it vaporizes. Unvaporized heavy
fuel oil and/or asphalt residue drops to the bottom of the tower, where it is
drawn off. The vapors rise through the distillation trays, which contain
perforations and bubble caps (Figure 10). Each tray permits vapors from
below to bubble through the cooler, condensed liquid on top of the tray. This

Petroleum Processing Overview

17

provides excellent vapor/liquid contacting. Condensed liquid flows down
through a pipe to the hotter tray below, where the higher temperature causes
re-evaporation. A given molecule evaporates and condenses many times
before finally leaving the tower.
Products are collected from the top, bottom and side of the column. Sidedraw products are taken from trays at which the temperature corresponds to
the cutpoint for a desired product. In modern towers, a portion of each sidedraw stream is returned to the tower to control tray temperatures and further
enhance separation. Part of the top product is also returned; this “reflux” flow
plays a major role in controlling temperature at the top of the tower.

Atmospheric distillation of the best crudes yields about 60% naphtha plus
middle distillates (kerosene and gas oil), but the average is closer to 40%. In
contrast, Table 9 shows that during 1991-2003, the United States consumed,
on average, 70% of its petroleum as gasoline and middle distillates. This

leaves a gap of about 30%, which is satisfied by converting residual oils into

Vacuum Distillation

The residue from an atmospheric distillation tower can be sent to a
vacuum distillation tower, which recovers additional liquid at 0.7 to 1.5 psia
(4.8 to 10.3 kPa). The vacuum, which is created by a vacuum pump or steam
ejector, is pulled from the top of the tower. Relative to atmospheric columns,
vacuum columns have larger diameters and their internals are simpler. Often,
instead of trays, random packing and demister pads are used.
The overhead stream – light vacuum gas oil – can be used as a lube base
stock, heavy fuel oil, or as feed to a conversion unit. Heavy vacuum gas oil is
pulled from a side draw. The vacuum residue can be use to make asphalt, or it
can be sent to a coker or visbreaker unit for further processing.

2.2

Solvent Refining

Distillation splits a mixture into fractions according to the boiling points of
the mixture constituents. In contrast, solvent refining segregates compounds
with similar compound types, such as paraffins and aromatics. The three main
types of solvent refining are solvent deasphalting, solvent extraction, and
solvent dewaxing.
2.2.1

Solvent Deasphalting

Solvent deasphalting takes advantage of the fact that aromatic compounds are insoluble in paraffins. Propane deasphalting is commonly
used to precipitate asphaltenes from residual oils. Deasphalted oil (DAO) is
sent to hydrotreaters, FCC units, hydrocrackers, or fuel-oil blending. In
hydrocrackers and FCC units, DAO is easier to process than straight-run
residual oils. This is because asphaltenes easily form coke and often contain
catalyst poisons such as nickel and vanadium, and the asphaltene content of
DAO is (by definition) almost zero.

Robinson

20

In traditional solvent deasphalting, residual oil and propane are pumped to
an extraction tower at 150 to 250°F (65 to 120°C) and 350 to 600 psig (2514
to 4240 kPa). Separation occurs in a tower, which may have a rotating disc
contactor (Figure 11). Liquid products are evaporated and steam stripped to
recover the propane solvent, which is recycled.
An advanced version of solvent deasphalting is “residuum oil supercritical
extraction,” or ROSE. The ROSETM Process was developed by the KerrMcGee Corporation and now is offered for license by KBR Engineering and
Construction, a subsidiary of Halliburton. In this process, the oil and solvent
are mixed and heated to above the critical temperature of the solvent, where
the oil is almost totally insoluble. Advantages include higher recovery of
deasphalted liquids, lower operating costs due to improved solvent recovery,
and improved energy efficiency. The ROSE process can employ three
different solvents, the choice of which depends upon process objectives:
Propane:
Preparation of lube base stocks
Butane :
Asphalt production
Pentane:
Maximum recovery of liquid
2.2.2

Solvent Extraction

Solvent extraction is used to remove aromatics and other impurities from
lube and grease stocks. The feedstock is dried, then contacted with the solvent
in a counter-current or rotating disk extraction unit (Figure 11). The solvent is
separated from the product stream by heating, evaporation, or fractionation.
Remaining traces of solvent are removed from the raffinate by steam stripping
or flashing. Electrostatic precipitators may be used to enhance separation of
inorganic compounds. The solvent is then regenerated and recycled.

Today, phenol, furfural, and cresylic acid are widely used as solvents. In
the past, some refiners installed the Edeleanu process, in which the solvent is
liquid sulfur dioxide, but the hazards of potential leaks made it undesirable.
Chlorinated ethers and nitrobenzene also have been used.
2.2.3

Solvent Dewaxing, Wax Deoiling

Solvent dewaxing removes wax (normal paraffins) from deasphalted lube
base stocks. The main process steps include mixing the feedstock with the
solvent, chilling the mixture to crystallize wax, and recovering the solvent.
Commonly used solvents include toluene and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK).
Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is used in a wax deoiling process to prepare
food-grade wax.

3.

CONVERSION

As mentioned in Section 1.1, the decreased use of kerosene lamps (thanks
to Thomas Edison) coupled with rising demand for automotive gasoline
provided incentives to convert kerosene and other heavier fractions into
gasoline.
Table 10 illustrates the fundamental principle behind conversion. For a
given class of hydrocarbons, “lighter” means lower molecular weight, lower
boiling point, lower density, and higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratios (H/C).
Methane, the lightest hydrocarbon, has an H/C of 4.0. Benzopyrene has an
H/C of 0.6. The H/C of commonly used crude oils ranges from 1.5 to 2.0, and
the H/C for asphaltenes is 1.15.

Most conversion processes – FCC, thermal cracking, and deasphalting –
increase the H/C by rejecting carbon. A few processes – hydrotreating to a
small extent and hydrocracking to a great extent – increase the H/C by adding
hydrogen. In this context, “rejecting carbon” does not mean that a little bit of

Robinson

22

carbon is removed from every molecule. Rather, it means that heavy
molecules are split (“cracked”) into a smaller molecule with a higher H/C and
another smaller molecule with a lower H/C. Molecules with low H/C –
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) – can condense to form coke (Figure 12).
Condensation reactions release hydrogen, lowering H/C even more.

3.1

Visbreaking

Visbreaking is a mild form of thermal cracking that achieves about 15%
conversion of atmospheric residue to gas oils and naphtha. At the same time, a
low-viscosity residual fuel is produced.
Visbreaking comes in two basic flavors – “short-contact” and “soaker.” In
short-contact visbreaking, the feed is heated to about 900°F (480°C) and sent
to a “soaking zone” (reactor) at 140 to 300 psig (1067 to 2170 kPa). The
elevated pressure allows cracking to occur while restricting coke formation.
To avoid over-cracking, the residence time in the soaking zone is short –
several minutes compared to several hours in a delayed coker – and the hot oil
is quenched with cold gas oil to inhibit further cracking and sent to a vacuum
tower for product separation. “Soaker” visbreaking keeps the hot oil at
elevated temperature for a longer time to increase the yield of middle
distillates. The low-viscosity visbreaker gas oil can be sent to an FCC unit or
hydrocracker for further processing, or used as heavy fuel oil.

3.2

Coking

Coking processes come in two basic forms – delayed coking, which is a
semi-batch process, and fluid-bed coking, which is continuous.
3.2.1

Delayed Coking

In a delayed coker, vacuum residue feed is heated to about 900 to 970°F
(487 to 520°C) and sent to a large coke drum. Cracking begins immediately,
generating coke and cracked, vaporized products. Coke stays behind in the
drum while the vapors rise to the top and flow to the product fractionator.
Liquid products include coker naphtha, light coker gas oil (LCGO), and
heavy coker gas oil (HCGO). All of these require further processing due to
their high olefins content, which makes then unstable and poorly suited for
direct blending into finished products. The coker naphtha and LCGO are
hydrotreated. The HCGO can go either to an FCC unit or a hydrocracker.

condensation reaction, which generates hydrogen, and dealkylation, which consumes hydrogen.

Meanwhile, hot residue keeps flowing into the drum until it is filled with
solid coke. To remove the coke, the top and bottom heads of the drum are
removed. A rotating cutting tool uses high-pressure jets of water to drill a hole
through the center of the coke from top to bottom. In addition to cutting the
hole, the water also cools the coke, forming steam as it does so. The cutter is
then raised, step by step, cutting the coke into lumps, which fall out the
bottom of the drum. Typically, coke drums operate on 18- to 24-hour cycles,
which include preheating the drum, filling it with hot oil, allowing coke and
liquid products to form, cooling the drum, and decoking.
Coke can account for up to 30 wt% of the product. It can be shipped by
rail, truck, or conveyor belt to a calciner, which converts green coke fresh
from the drum into various grades of petroleum coke. Green coke can also be
used for fuel.
Sponge Coke. Sponge coke is named for its sponge-like appearance. It is
produced from feeds that have low-to-moderate asphaltene concentrations. If
sponge coke meets certain specifications, it can be used to make carbon
anodes for the aluminum industry. Otherwise, it is used for fuel. “Green”
sponge coke must be calcined before it can be used for anodes. Fuel coke may
not require calcination.
Needle Coke. Needle coke, named for its needle-like structure, is made
from feeds that contain nil asphaltenes, such as hydrotreated FCC decant oils.
Needle coke is a high-value product used to make graphite electrodes for
electric-arc furnaces in the steel industry. At present (April 2004), needle coke
fetches more than US$500 per ton, which is significantly greater than the
US$40 to US$45 per ton price for metallurgical coke exported from the
United States.
Shot Coke. Shot coke is an undesirable product because it is inconsistent
and in some cases dangerous. It is produced when the concentration of
feedstock asphaltenes and/or coke-drum temperatures are too high. Excessive
feedstock oxygen content can also induce its formation.
Shot coke begins to form as the oil flows into the coke drum. As light ends
flash away, small globules of heavy tar are left behind. These globs of tar

Robinson

24

coke rapidly grow due to the heat produced by asphaltene polymerization,
producing discrete mini-balls 0.1 to 0.2 inches (2 to 5 mm) in diameter. In the
center of the drum, the mini-balls can stick together to form clusters as large
as 10 inches (25 cm). On occasion, a cluster breaks apart when the coke drum
is opened, spraying a volley of hot mini-balls in every direction. Adding
aromatic feeds, such as FCC decant oil, can eliminate shot coke formation.
Other methods of eliminating shot coke – decreasing temperature, increasing
drum pressure, increasing the amount of product recycle – decrease liquid
yields, which is not desired.
A quantitative measure of the quality of coke is the coefficient of thermal
expansion (CTE). A low CTE means that the product has a low tendency to
expand when heated. Ranges of CTE for the three major types of petroleum
coke are shown in Table 11.
Table 11. Coefficients of Thermal Expansion for Petroleum Coke Products
Product

Needle coke
0 to 4
Sponge coke

Shot coke
>20

Shot coke cannot be used in making anodes for aluminum production,
because the outer layer of a shot sphere has a very low CTE while the inside
has a very high CTE. When rapidly heated, the interior expands, cracking the
outer layer like an egg shell. Consequently, in aluminum smelters, shot-coke
anodes quickly turn to dust.
Other specialty carbon products made from petroleum include recarburizer
coke, which is used to make specialty steel, and titanium dioxide coke, which is
used as a reducing agent in the titanium dioxide pigment industry.29
3.2.2

Fluid Coking

Fluid coking, also called continuous coking, is a moving-bed process for
which the operating temperature is higher than the temperatures used for
delayed coking. In continuous coking, hot recycled coke particles are
combined with liquid feed in a radial mixer (reactor) at about 50 psig (446
kPa). Vapors are taken from the reactor, quenched to stop any further
reaction, and fractionated. The coke goes to a surge drum, then to a classifier,
where the larger particles are removed as product. The smaller coke particles
are recycled to a preheater, where they mix with fresh feed. Coking occurs
both in the reactor and in the surge drum.
Installation costs for fluid coking are somewhat higher than for delayed
coking, but feeds can be heavier and heat losses are lower.

Fluid Catalytic Cracking

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produces more that half the world’s
gasoline. A typical FCC unit comprises three major sections – riser/reactor,
regenerator, and fractionation. Table 12 provides important details on FCC.

3.3.1

FCC Process Flow

Figure 13 shows a sketch for the riser/reactor section of an FCC unit. In
the reaction section, preheated oil is mixed with hot, regenerated catalyst. The
mixture acts as a fluid because the catalyst particles are small – about the size
of sifted flour. The hot catalyst vaporizes the oil, and the vaporized oil carries
the catalyst up the riser/reactor. A book by Magee and Dolbear30 provides

Robinson

26

specific information on the manufacture and use of catalysts used for FCC
and other refining processes.
The cracking reaction is very fast. It produces light gases, high-octane
gasoline, and heavier products called light cycle oil (LCO), heavy cycle oil
(HCO), slurry oil, and decant oil. It also leaves a layer of coke on the catalyst
particles, making them inactive.
At the top of the riser, the temperature can reach 900 to 1020°F (482 to
549°C). The temperature at the riser outlet is a key factor in determining
conversion and product selectivity, so FCC operators control it as tightly as
possible. Higher temperatures favor production of olefin-rich light gas at the
expense of gasoline, moderate temperatures favor gasoline production, and at
lower temperatures gasoline yields decrease in favor of middle distillates.
In the disengaging section, steam is used to help separate the nowdeactivated catalyst from the reaction products. The catalyst goes to the
regenerator, where the coke is burned away by fluidized combustion in the
presence of air. The hot catalyst at temperatures up to 1350°F (732°C) returns
to the riser/reactor, where the cycle begins again.
In a 60,000 barrels-per-day unit processing a typical mixture of vacuum
gas oils, the total catalyst in the unit (the “inventory”) is 400 to 500 tons. To
maintain activity, about 0.5 to 1 wt% of the inventory is replaced each day. If
the feed to the unit contains significant amounts of residue, the replacement
rate is higher. The discharged catalyst is cooled and shipped either to a land
fill for disposal or to another refiner, which may have a particular use for
“conditioned” FCC catalyst.
3.3.2

Heat Balance

FCC units must be heat-balanced, or they won’t run. Understanding heat
balance is the key to understanding how FCC variables interact. The burning
of coke in the regenerator provides all of the heat required by the process.

Houdry Catalytic Cracking (HCC)

The Houdry Catalytic Cracking (HCC) process was a precursor to FCC.
Houdry catalyst particles are pellets, which are carried to a storage hopper by
a conveyor belt or pneumatic lift tubes. The pellets flow down from the
hopper through the reactor, and from the reactor to a regenerator. The HCC
product slate is similar to that for FCC, but FCC conversions and gasoline
yields are significantly higher.

Robinson

28

3.3.4

Residue FCC

Many modern FCC units are designed to process significant amounts of
vacuum residue. These units use catalyst coolers (e.g., steam coils) in the
regenerator or a second regeneration zone to remove excess heat from the
unit. This is because vacuum residue generates substantially more coke than
conventional FCC feeds, and excess heat is generated when the extra coke is
burned away from catalyst.
In vacuum residue, the metals content can be very high – sometimes more
than 200 wppm nickel-plus-vanadium. In an FCC unit, these metals are bad
news. Nickel increases coke formation and decreases liquid yields. Vanadium
reduces conversion, decreases liquid yields, and destroys the catalyst. For
these reasons, refiners pretreat the residue in a hydrotreater before sending it
on to the FCC.
In addition to removing most of the Ni and V, the pretreater decreases the
concentration of sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics. In the FCC, part of the feed
sulfur ends up in liquid products and part ends up as sulfur oxides (SOx) in
the flue gas, so removing sulfur from the feed is beneficial. Removing
nitrogen is beneficial because feed nitrogen suppresses FCC catalyst activity.
Saturating feed aromatics increases FCC conversion by as much as 10 vol%.
This alone can justify the cost of building the pretreater.

3.4

Hydrotreating and Hydrocracking

A modern petroleum refinery may have four or more hydrotreating units.
Strictly speaking, hydrotreaters are not conversion units because the breaking
of carbon-to-carbon bonds is minimal. However, it is convenient to discuss
hydrotreating together with hydrocracking and mild hydrocracking because
they employ similar catalysts and process flow schemes.
The key differences are presented in Table 14. Hydrocrackers tend to
operate at higher pressure, using different catalysts, and with lower linear
hourly space velocity (LHSV). LHSV is equal to the volume of feed per hour
divided by the catalyst volume. A lower required LHSV means that a given
volume of feed requires more catalyst. In terms of process conditions and
conversion, mild hydrocracking lies somewhere between hydrotreating and
full-conversion hydrocracking.

Hydrotreating Process Flow

Figure 14 illustrates the process flow for a fixed-bed hydrotreater. At
moderate-to-high pressure – 300 to 1800 psig (2170 to 12,512 kPa) – mixtures
of preheated oil and hydrogen pass down over fixed beds of catalyst, in which
the desired reactions occur.

Robinson

Hydrotreating is exothermic (heat-releasing), so many commercial units
comprise several catalyst beds separated by quench zones. In a quench zone,
hot process fluids from the preceding bed are mixed with relatively cold,
hydrogen-rich quench gas before passing to the next bed.

HDS and HDN reactions produce H2S and NH3, respectively. Wash water
is injected into the effluent from the last reactor to remove ammonia, which
goes into the aqueous phase as ammonium bisulfide, NH4HS(aq). The
NH4HS(aq) is rejected from the unit as sour water in downstream flash drums.
In the high-pressure flash drum, liquid products are separated from the
hydrogen-rich gas, which is recycled to the reactors. In most hydrotreaters
designed for deep desulfurization, H2S is removed from the recycle gas with a
high-pressure amine absorber. The liquids go to a stripping column, which
removes entrained H2S and other light gases. These go to a low-pressure
amine absorber and then to either a gas plant or the refinery fuel-gas system.

Petroleum Processing Overview

31

The destination of the liquid is unit-specific. In some hydrotreaters, the
stripped liquid goes directly to product blending. In others, it goes to one or
more fractionation towers.
Naphtha Hydrotreating. Heavy naphthas generally have low octane
numbers, often less than 60 RON. To raise the octane, refiners use catalytic
reforming units. Alternatively, heavy naphtha can go to an isomerization unit,
which also makes high-octane products. In both reforming and isomerization,
the catalysts are sulfur-sensitive, so a naphtha hydrotreater is used to lower
the feed sulfur content, usually to <1 wppm. Some nitrogen is removed, too,
which also is beneficial.
Table 16 provides additional details on hydrotreating.

3.4.3

Hydrotreating Objectives

Catalytic hydrotreating removes contaminants from liquid petroleum
fractions. It also saturates most olefins and many aromatic compounds. Sulfur,
nitrogen, oxygen, and metals are the most troublesome impurities. If not
removed, they can deactivate catalysts, contaminate finished products, and
accelerate corrosion in downstream equipment.
Gasoline Hydrotreating. In the context of post-treating gasoline to meet
recent sulfur specifications, Section 8.2.5 discusses gasoline hydrotreating.
Temperatures and pressures are relatively mild, but the leading processes use
multiple catalysts, multiple catalyst beds, and/or pre-fractionation to minimize
loss of gasoline octane.
Kerosene Hydrotreating. Straight-run kerosene streams may not meet
specifications for jet-fuel. By using mild hydrodearomatization (HDA) to
convert some aromatic compounds into cleaner-burning naphthenes, low-severity
hydrotreating can convert kerosene into jet fuel. In many parts of the world, lowsulfur kerosene is used for home heating. In those regions, straight-run kerosene
and other light gas oils usually must be hydrotreated.

32

Robinson

Diesel Hydrotreating. From 1991 in Sweden, 1995 in California, and 1998
in the rest of the U.S., hydrotreating was used to make diesel containing <500
wppm sulfur. Generally, diesel hydrotreaters operate at higher pressures than
naphtha and kerosene units, and they often use different catalysts. These days,
under pressure to make ULSD by the end of 2006, most U.S. refiners either
have or will be (a) building new diesel hydrotreaters, (b) revamping existing
units by changing catalysts, modifying reactor internals, adding a highpressure H2S absorber, and/or adding a new reactor, or (c) converting other
units to diesel service.
FCC Feed Pretreating: VGO, CGO, and VBGO. For hydrotreaters that
prepare feed for conventional FCC units, removing nitrogen (HDN) from the
feed is beneficial, because organic nitrogen (especially basic nitrogen) inhibits
cracking by binding to the highly acidic active sites in FCC catalysts. The
removal of sulfur (HDS) can reduce the size of, or eliminate the need for,
FCC gasoline post-treating units. By converting aromatics to naphthenes
(HDA), FCC feed pretreaters increase feed “crackability.” In FCC and other
thermal cracking units, naphthenes convert to lighter products. But except for
losing side chains, aromatics are rather inert. If anything, they tend to form
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and coke. Pretreaters also benefit FCC
units by removing metals (primarily nickel and vanadium) and Conradson
carbon (CCR). CCR correlates strongly with the tendency of a feed to form
coke in a delayed coking unit. It also correlates with coke-formation in an
FCC unit. By reducing feed CCR, a pretreater allows an FCC to operate at
higher feed rates and/or higher conversion. If the feed rate stays constant, the
conversion can increase by 10 to 20 vol%. The extent of the increase depends
upon the properties of the raw feed and the conditions under which the feed is
hydrotreated.
FCC Feed Pretreating: Residue. Originally, residue hydrotreaters were
built to reduce the sulfur content of heavy fuel oil. These days, a large
percentage of residue hydrotreaters are used to pretreat FCC feeds. Residue
hydrotreating requires higher pressure, lower LHSV, and at least one hot flash
drum after the reactors. Another main difference is the need to use one or
more HDM catalysts to protect the HDS catalyst from metals such as nickel
and vanadium. If not removed, Ni and V accelerate deactivation and the
buildup of pressure-drop. In the Resid Unionfining process offered by UOP,
HDM catalyst is loaded into a guard reactor upstream from the main reactors.
In the RDS process offered by Chevron Lummus Global, an OCR (“onstream
catalyst replacement”) or UFR (“up-flow reactor”) unit removes metals from
the RDS feed. With OCR, a refiner can process residues containing 400
wppm metals (Ni + V).
Lube Hydrotreating. The mild hydrotreating (“hydrofinishing”) of lube
oils improves color, odor, and stability by removing olefins, sulfides and
mercaptans. Severe hydrotreating also removes aromatics, nitrogen, and
refractory sulfur compounds.

Petroleum Processing Overview

33

Pyrolysis Gasoline Hydrotreating. Hydrotreating improves the quality
of pyrolysis gasoline (pygas), a by-product from olefins plants. In the past,
due to its high octane, some pygas was blended into gasoline. Pygas contains
diolefins, which react with air to form gums. Mild hydrotreating converts
diolefins into mono-olefins. This improves the stability of pygas.
3.4.4

Hydrocracking

As shown in Table 14, the major difference between hydrotreating,
hydrocracking, and mild hydrocracking is the extent to which conversion
occurs. In a hydrocracking unit designed for high conversion of vacuum gas
oil, the process flow is more complex. The unit probably operates at a much
higher pressure. It may include an additional reactor, a hot high-pressure
separator, and a multiple-column fractionation section. To achieve near-total
conversion of fresh feed, unconverted oil may be recycled. Some details about
hydrocracking are given in Table 17.

Hydrocracking Objectives

For a given hydrocracker, process objectives can include:
Maximum production of naphtha
Maximum production of middle distillate fuels
Flexibility to swing between production of naphtha and middle distillates
Production of ultra-clean lube base stocks
Production of olefin plant feeds.

3.4.6

Hydrocracker Feeds

Liquid feeds can be atmospheric or vacuum gas oils from crude distillation
units; gas oils (light and heavy) from delayed cokers, fluid cokers, or
visbreakers; and cycle oils (light and heavy) from FCC units.
3.4.7

Hydrocracking Process Flow

The process flow scheme in Figure 14 can describe a gas-oil hydrotreater,
a mild hydrocracking, or a once-through high-conversion hydrocracker. In a
hydrocracker, the first few beds are likely to contain hydrotreating catalyst
while subsequent beds contain hydrocracking catalyst. In some hydrocrackers
designed for maximum production of diesel fuel, all catalyst beds contain
hydrocracking catalyst. Other hydrocracking process flow schemes are
described in Chapters 7 and 8.

Robinson

34

3.4.8

Hydrocracker Products

Middle distillates (jet and diesel) from high-conversion hydrocrackers
meet or exceed finished product specifications. The heavy naphtha, however,
usually goes to a catalytic reformer for octane improvement. The fractionator
bottoms from partial conversion units can be sent to an FCC unit, an olefins
plant, or a lube plant.
Due to the fact that products from a hydrocracker are less dense than the
feeds, the total volume of liquid products is greater than the feed volume by
10 to 30 vol%. This phenomenon is called volume swell.

Ebullated Bed Units

In fixed-bed hydrocrackers designed to process VGO, residual oils in the
feed can reduce catalyst cycle life if they contain even trace amounts of salts,
asphaltenes, refractory carbon, trace metals (Fe, Ni, V), or particulate matter.
As mentioned in Section 3.4.2, fixed-bed units designed to process residue
remove metals and other contaminants with upstream guard beds or onstream
catalyst replacement technology. In contrast, ebullated bed hydrocrackers can
and do process significant amounts of residual oils. This is because fresh

Petroleum Processing Overview

35

catalyst is added and spent catalyst is removed continuously. Consequently,
catalyst life does not impose limitations on feed selection or conversion.
Ebullated bed processes are offered for license by Axens (IFP) ABB
Lummus. In ebullated bed reactors, hydrogen-rich recycle gas bubbles up
through a mixture of oil and catalyst particles to provide three-phase turbulent
mixing. The reaction environment can be nearly isothermal, which improves
product selectivity. At the top of the reactor, catalyst particles are disengaged
from the process fluids, which are separated in downstream flash drums. Most
of the catalyst goes back to the reactor. Some is withdrawn and replaced with
fresh catalyst.

UPGRADING NAPHTHA

Gasoline is produced by blending several different refinery streams –
butanes, straight-run gasoline, reformate, alkylate, isomerate, FCC gasoline,
oxygenates, and others. This section gives an overview of the processes that
either upgrade or generate gasoline blend stocks.

4.1

Catalytic Reforming

4.1.1

Catalytic Reforming Objectives

Catalytic reforming converts low-octane heavy naphtha into a high-octane
product (reformate) that is an excellent gasoline blend stock. Reformate has a
high content of BTX (benzene-toluene-xylene), so it also serves as a great
source of aromatics for petrochemical plants.
In addition to making aromatic compounds, catalytic reformers produce
hydrogen, which is used in hydrotreaters, hydrocrackers, and other hydrogenaddition processes.
4.1.2

Chemistry of Catalytic Reforming

The chemistry of catalytic reforming includes the reactions listed in Table
18. All are desirable except hydrocracking, which converts valuable C5-plus
molecules into light gases. The conversion of naphthenes to aromatics and the
isomerization of normal paraffins provide a huge boost in octane. H2 is
produced by dehydrocyclization of paraffins and naphthene dehydrogenation,
which are shown in Figure 15.

4.1.3

Catalytic Reforming Catalysts

Catalytic reforming catalysts contain highly dispersed platinum (Pt), the
activity of which is inhibited by sulfur. Therefore, an upstream hydrotreater
lowers the sulfur content of reformer feeds to <1 wppm. In addition to Pt,
modern multi-metallic catalysts contain highly dispersed rhenium (Re) and in
some cases tin (Sn).
4.1.4

Process Flows

There are three major process flows for catalytic reforming:
Semi-regenerative
Cyclic
Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR)
Figure 18 shows a semi-regenerative reformer, a fixed-bed unit in which
catalyst cycles last from 6 to 12 months. A catalyst cycle ends when the unit
is unable to meet its process objectives – typically octane and overall C5-plus
yields. At the end of a cycle, the entire unit is brought down and catalyst is
regenerated. In a cyclic reformer, catalyst cycles are shorter – 20 to 40 hours –
but they are staggered so that only one reactor goes down at a time. In a CCR
unit, the catalyst is slowly but constantly moving from the reactor to the
regenerator and back again.
•
•
•

Robinson

38

In a semi-regenerative unit, desulfurized naphtha is mixed with hydrogen,
heated to >900°F (>480°C) and passed through a series of fixed-bed reactors.
The major chemical reactions – dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization – are
endothermic (heat absorbing), and the reactors themselves are essentially
adiabatic. This means that heat can’t enter or leave except by the cooling or
heating of reaction fluids. Consequently, the temperature drops as reactants
flow through a reactor. Between reactors, fired heaters bring the process fluids
back to desired reactor inlet temperatures.

Figure 18. Semi-regenerative catalytic reforming

Some catalytic reformers operate at low pressure (100 psig, 791 kPa),
while others operate at >500 psig (3549 kPa). Low operating pressure
improves yields of aromatics and hydrogen, but it accelerates catalyst
deactivation by increasing the rate at which coke forms on the catalyst. In a
CCR reformer, the catalyst always is being regenerated, so increased coking is
less problematic. Therefore, CCR units can operate at very low pressures. In
most reformers, the feed is spiked with an organic chloride, which converts to
hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the reactors. The HCl increases catalyst acidity
and helps to minimize catalyst coking.
The effluent from the last reactor is cooled and sent to a separator, from
which hydrogen-rich gas is removed and recycled to the reactors. The liquid
product flows to a stabilizer column, where entrained gases are removed,
before going to the gasoline blender or aromatics plant.

Petroleum Processing Overview

39

In a CCR unit (Figure 19), the hydrotreated feed mixes with recycle
hydrogen and goes to series of adiabatic, radial-flow reactors arranged in a
vertical stack. Catalyst flows down the stack, while the reaction fluids flow
radially across the annular catalyst beds. The predominant reforming reactions
are endothermic, so heaters are used between reactors to reheat the charge to
reaction temperature. Flue gas from the fired heaters is typically used to generate
steam.

Figure 19. CCR catalytic reforming

The effluent from the last reactor is cooled and sent to a separator. Part of
the vapor is compressed and recycled to the reactors. The rest is compressed,
combined with separator liquids, and sent to the product recovery section.
Liquids from the recovery section go to a stabilizer, where light saturates are
removed from the C6-plus aromatic products.
Partly deactivated catalyst is continually withdrawn from the bottom of the
reactor stack and sent to the regenerator. As the catalyst flows down through the
regenerator, the coke is burned away. Regenerated catalyst is lifted by hydrogen to the top of the reactor stack. Because the reactor and regenerator
sections are separate, each operates at its own optimum conditions. The
regeneration section can be temporarily shut down for maintenance without
affecting the operation of the reactor and product recovery sections.

4.2

Isomerization

4.2.1

Isomerization Objectives

As we have seen, isomerization occurs as a side-reaction in all conversion
processes. But in refining, when we say “isomerization process,” we are
referring specifically to the on-purpose isomerization of n-butane, n-pentane,
and n-hexane. The main purpose of n-paraffin isomerization is to produce isoparaffins with substantially higher octane numbers. An isomerization reaction
for normal hexane was shown in Figure 17.
Some details about paraffin isomerization processes are given in Table 20.

Section 8.2.1 lists octane numbers for heavy naphtha and some normal and
iso-paraffins. N-butane has a high octane number (92), so refiners blend as
much of it as possible into gasoline. But n-butane also evaporates easily,
which means that tighter restrictions on the RVP (volatility) of gasoline limit
its C4 content (see Section 8.2.2). In many locales, this creates an excess of nbutane. By converting it into isobutane, which is consumed in alkylation
units, refiners can reduce or eliminate this excess of n-butane.

Petroleum Processing Overview

4.2.2

41

Isomerization Catalysts

The most common catalyst for isomerising n-butane is platinum (Pt) on
alumina promoted by chloride. The high activity of this catalyst allows
operation at relatively low temperature. This is beneficial because the reaction
is controlled by equilibrium; at low temperature, equilibrium favors isobutane.
Pt/alumina catalysts can’t be regenerated, and they are highly sensitive to
water and other contaminants.
In units that isomerize n-pentane and n-hexane, the reactions are catalyzed
either by Pt/alumina or Pt on zeolite. The zeolite catalysts require higher
temperatures, but they are less sensitive to water. As with butane
isomerization, the reactions are controlled by equilibrium, so lower reaction
temperatures favor branched isomers. The high temperatures required by
zeolite catalysts reduce the octane of the product relative to products made at
lower temperatures with chlorided alumina catalysts.
4.2.3

Process Flow: C4 Isomerization

The feed to a butane (C4) isomerization unit should contain maximum
amounts of n-butane and only small amounts of isobutane, pentanes, and
heavier material. The feed is dried, combined with dry makeup hydrogen, and
charged to the reactor section at 230 to 340° F (110 to 170°C) and 200 to 300
psig (1480 to 2170 kPa). H2 is not consumed by isomerization reactions, but it
suppresses polymerization of the olefin intermediates that are formed during
the reaction. A small amount of organic chloride promoter, which is added to
maintain catalyst activity, converts completely to HCl in the reactors.
Often, two reactors in series are used to increase on-stream efficiency. The
catalyst in one reactor can be replaced while the other continues to operate.
The reactor effluent (isomerate) flows to a stabilizer. A caustic scrubber
removes HCl from the separated light gases. The stabilized liquid product
comprises a near-equilibrium mixture of n-butane and isobutanes, plus a small
amount of heavier hydrocarbons. Losses due to cracking are less than 1 wt%.
The isomerate can be blended directly into gasoline or sent to an alkylation
unit. N-butane from an alkylation unit can be recycled to a butane
isomerization unit to achieve nearly total conversion of n-butane into
isobutane or alkylate.
4.2.4

Process Flow: C5C6 Isomerization

Pentane/hexane (C5C6) isomerization processes increase the octane of light
gasoline. In a typical unit, dried, hydrotreated feed is mixed with a small
amount of organic chloride and recycled hydrogen, then heated to reaction
temperature.

Robinson

42

Process objectives determine whether one or two reactors are used. In tworeactor units (Figure 20), the feed flows first to a saturation reactor, which
removes olefins and (to a large extent) benzene. After saturation, the feed
goes to an isomerization reactor, where normal paraffins are converted to
isoparaffins.

The reactor effluent flows to a product separator, where hydrogen is
separated from the other reaction products. Recovered hydrogen can go to a
recycle compressor, which returns it to the reactors, or it can be treated and
sent to the fuel gas system. Separator liquids go to a stabilizer column, which
removes light gases and remaining dissolved hydrogen. The stabilized liquid
goes to storage or gasoline blending. If sent to a fractionator, n-pentane and nhexane can be recycled to the isomerization unit for increased conversion.

Catalytic Oligomerization

4.3.1

Catalytic Oligomerization Objectives

Catalytic oligomerization also is called catalytic polymerization, catpoly,
and catalytic condensation. The process converts C3 and C4 olefins into C6 to
C9 olefins, which are excellent gasoline blend stocks. Per Table 22, the
research octane numbers for C and
C 8olefins such as methyl-2-pentenes
6
and 2,2,4-trimethylpentenes are greater than 97.
Variations on the process make higher olefins and aromatics such as
cumeme for petrochemical applications. Figure 21 shows the main chemical

pre-treatment to remove sulfur and other undesirable compounds, the olefinrich feed is sent to the reactor. The reaction is exothermic, so temperatures are
controlled by diluting the feed with product and by injecting relatively cold
feedstock (quench) between beds in the reactor. Temperatures range from 300
to 450°F (150 to 230°F) and pressures range from 200 to 1,200 psig (1480 to
8375 kPa).
Reaction products go to stabilization and/or fractionator systems to
separate gases – saturated and unsaturated C3-C4 compounds – from the liquid
product. The gases are recycled to the reactor, and the liquid product goes to
gasoline blending.

Alkylation Objectives

Alkylation processes combine light olefins (primarily propylene and
butylene) with isobutane in the presence of a highly acidic catalyst, either
sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid. The product (alkylate) contains a mixture of
high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons. Figure 23 illustrates the
reaction between isobutane and trans-2-butene. Alkylate is a highly desirable
gasoline blend stock because, in addition to its high octane, it has a low vapor
pressure. The octane of the product depends on the operating condition and
the kinds of olefins used.

with a concentration of 85 to 95%. The reactor is divided into zones. Olefins
are fed through distributors to each zone, and sulfuric acid and isobutanes
flow over baffles from one zone to the next.
The reactor effluent goes to a settler, in which hydrocarbons separate from
the acid. The acid is returned to the reactor. The hydrocarbons are washed
with caustic and sent to fractionation. The fractionation section comprises a
depropanizer, a deisobutanizer, and a debutanizer. Alkylate from the
deisobutanizer can go directly to motor-fuel blending, or it can be reprocessed
to produce aviation-grade gasoline. Isobutane is recycled.
4.4.3

Process Flow: HF Alkylation

Figure 24 shows a process schematic for hydrofluoric acid (HF)
alkylation. Olefins and isobutane are dried and fed to a reactor, where the
alkylation reaction takes place over the HF catalyst. The reactor effluent flows
to a settler, where the acid phase separates from the hydrocarbon phase. The
acid is drawn off and recycled. The hydrocarbon phase goes to a
deisobutanizer (DIB). The overhead stream, containing propane, isobutane,
and residual HF, goes to a depropanizer (DeC3). The DeC3 overhead goes to
an HF stripper. It is then treated with caustic and sent to storage. Isobutane
from the DIB main fractionator is recycled. The bottom stream from the
debutanizer goes to product blending.

LUBES, WAXES AND GREASES

“Bottom of the barrel” fractions – atmospheric and vacuum residues – can
be converted by the processes described in Sections 2 and 3, or they can be
used to make lubes, waxes and greases.

5.1

Lube Base Stocks

Refiners prepare lube base stocks from residual oils by removing
asphaltenes, aromatics, and waxes. Lube base stocks are hydrofinished,
blended with other distillate streams for viscosity adjustment, and
compounded with additives to produce finished lubricants.
Solvent-based processes for removing asphaltenes, aromatics and waxes
were discussed in Section 2.2. The next few paragraphs give a quick overview
of catalytic dewaxing.
5.1.1

Catalytic dewaxing

Catalytic dewaxing (CDW) was developed by Exxon Mobil in the 1980s. The
process employs a shape-selective zeolite called ZSM-5, which selectively
converts waxy n-paraffins into lighter hydrocarbons.
The Isodewaxing Process, commercialized in 1993 by ChevronTexaco,
catalytically isomerizes n-paraffins into iso-paraffins. This decreases the wax
content and increases the concentration low-viscosity hydrocarbons, both of
which are desirable. Isodewaxing also removes sulfur and nitrogen, and it
saturates aromatics. Products have a high viscosity index (VI), low pour point,
and excellent response to additives.
Catalytic dewaxing and Isodewaxing are discussed in more detail in the
second volume of this book.

5.2

Waxes

The raffinate from the solvent extraction unit in a traditional lube plant
contains a considerable amount of wax. To recover the wax, the raffinate is
mixed with a solvent, usually propane, and cooled in a series of heat
exchangers. Further cooling is provided by the evaporation of propane in the
chiller and filter feed tanks. The wax forms crystals, which are continuously
removed, filtered, and washed with cold solvent. The solvent is recovered by
flashing and steam stripping. The wax is purified by heating with hot solvent,
after which it is re-chilled, re-filtered and given a final wash.
Paraffin waxes are used to make candles and coated papers for use as
bread wrappers, cold-drink cups, and beverage cartons. They are also used in

Petroleum Processing Overview

47

building materials. The market for packaging is declining, but other uses are
on the rise, especially in construction.31

5.3

Greases

Greases are made by blending salts of long-chained fatty acids into
lubricating oils at temperatures of 400 to 600°F (204 to 315°C). Antioxidants
are added to provide stability. Some greases are batch-produced, while others
are made continuously. The characteristics of a grease depend to a great
extent on the counter-ion (calcium, sodium, aluminum, lithium, etc.) in the
fatty-acid salt.

6.

ASPHALT PRODUCTION

Asphalt can be produced directly from vacuum residue or by solvent
deasphalting (see Section 2.2).
Road-Tar Asphalt. Vacuum residue is used to make road-tar asphalt. To
drive off remaining light ends, it is heated to about 750°F (400°C) and charged
to a column where a vacuum is applied.
In road-paving, the petroleum residue serves as a binder for aggregate,
which can include stone, sand, or gravel. The aggregate comprises about 95%
of the final mixture. Polymers are added to the binder to improve strength and
durability.
The recommended material for paving highways in the United States is
Superpave32 hot-mix asphalt. Superpave was developed in 1987-93 during a
US$50 million research project sponsored by the Federal Highway
Administration.
Roofing Asphalt. Roofing asphalt is produced by blowing, which involves
the oxidation of asphalt flux by bubbling air through liquid asphalt at 260°C
(500°F) for 1 to 10 hours. During this process, organic sulfur is converted to
H2S and SO2. Catalytic salts such as ferric chloride (FeCl3) may be used to
adjust product properties and increase the rates of the blowing reactions,
which are exothermic. To provide cooling, water is sprayed into the top of the
blowing vessel, creating a blanket of steam that captures sulfur-containing
gases, light hydrocarbons, and other gaseous contaminants. These are
recovered downstream. Cooling water may also by sprayed on the outside of
the vessel.
The length of the blow depends on desired product properties, such as
softening temperature and penetration rate. A typical plant blows four to six
batches of asphalt per 24-hour day. There are two primary substrates for
roofing asphalt – organic (paper felt) and fiberglass. The production of feltbased roofing shingles consists of:

Saturating the paper felt with asphalt
Coating the saturated felt with filled asphalt
Pressing granules of sand, talc or mica into the coating
Cooling with water, drying, cutting and trimming, and packaging
If fiberglass is used as the base instead of paper felt, the saturation step is
eliminated.

7.

DRYING, SWEETENING, AND TREATING

Drying, sweetening and treating are not as glamorous as extraction and
conversion, or even distillation, but they are essential to the performance and
safety of finished products. In lubricating oils, traces of olefins and sulfur
compounds can form gums and accelerate degradation. At high altitude,
excess water in jet fuel can freeze and plug fuel lines. Traces of mercaptans
and disulfides in “sour” gasoline can react with water in storage tanks to
produce toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide.

7.1

Drying and Sweetening

Light gas streams produced by various refinery units are collected and
piped to treating plants, where:
• Propane is recovered for LPG
• Propylene is removed for use in petrochemical plants
• Butanes and butenes are removed for use as alkylation feeds
• Heavier components are recovered and sent to gasoline blending
Knock-out drums collect easy-to-condense liquids, but if necessary drying
agents – alumina, silica, or molecular sieves – are used to remove the final
traces of water. Some processes use beds of molecular sieves to dry and
sweeten at the same time.
Gases containing hydrogen sulfide are scrubbed in trayed contactors with
aqueous amines such as diethanolamine (DEA). Hydrogen sulfide is stripped
from the “rich” amine with steam and recycled to the contactor. In a properly
operating unit, the sweetened gas contains <10 wppm H2S.

7.2

Treating

Treating improves the odor, color, and stability of straight-run liquids and
conversion-unit products. Sulfuric acid treating removes olefins, sulfur,
nitrogen, oxygen compounds, and other contaminants. Clay/lime treating of
acid-treated oil removes any residual traces of asphaltenes. Caustic treating

Petroleum Processing Overview

49

with sodium (or potassium) hydroxide removes naphthenic acids, phenols,
mercaptans, and H2S.
If the concentration of organic sulfur exceeds the capacity of a caustic or
acid treater, the stream must be sent to a hydrotreater.

8.

PRODUCT BLENDING

8.1

Product Specifications

Liquid products from modern refineries comprise several individual
streams, which are blended to meet desired specifications. Product
specifications developed by ASTM – the American Society for Testing and
Materials – are widely used throughout the world. Table 21 lists some
common refinery products along with their ASTM designations.

Analogous institutions in other countries – for example, the Japanese
Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) and the British Standards Institution
(BSI) – serve similar functions. BSI developed the ISO9000 series of
standards for managing manufacturing processes.
In addition to setting specifications, these institutions develop and publish
test methods used to analyze a wide variety of materials. ASTM and its
international cousins cooperate with each other, and they work closely with
government regulators. For example, recent low-sulfur gasoline and diesel
directives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are incorporated
into D975-04 and D4814-03a, respectively.
Other widely used tests and specifications are defined by licensors. For
example, UOP‘s Laboratory Test Methods, distributed by ASTM, defines
several hundred procedures for analyzing catalysts, chemicals and fuels.
Axens (IFP), ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil and other licensors also distribute
test methods to process licensees.
Additives are an essential component of finished fuels. They increase
stability, improve flow properties and enhance performance. For example,
cetane-improvers are routinely added to diesel fuel, and additives that prevent
intake-valve deposits are now required in all grades of gasoline in the United
States.

Gasoline Blending

Forty years ago, making gasoline was a relatively simple task. If a mixture
of components met specifications for volatility and octane, it could be shipped
to retail outlets and sold as-was. If the octane was low, the problem could be
fixed by adding a little tetraethyl lead. Butanes could be added as needed to
adjust volatility.
In fact, volatility and octane are still the two most important properties of
gasoline. The volatility must be high enough to vaporize during cold weather;
otherwise, engines won’t start. And octane is still one of the best predictors of
performance in a spark-ignition gasoline engine.
8.2.1 Octane Numbers for Hydrocarbons
In a spark-ignition engine, some compounds start to burn before they reach
the spark plug. This premature ignition causes knocking, which reduces the
power of the engine, increases engine wear, and in some cases causes serious
damage.
Octane number is a measure of the propensity of fuels to knock in gasoline
engines. It is based on an arbitrary scale in which the octane number of nheptane is zero and the octane number of isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) is
100. When a fuel is tested in a standard single-cylinder engine, mixtures of
isooctane and n-heptane are used as standards. ASTM D2699 and ASTM
D2700 describe methods for measuring research octane number (RON) and
motor octane number (MON), respectively. The engine speed for the RON
test is 600 rpm, while 900 rpm is used for the MON test. RONC and MONC
are sometimes used instead to RON and MON. The “C” stands for clear,
which means that the fuel does not contain lead or manganese additives.
Table 22 presents RON and MON values for several pure compounds.
Aromatics, olefins, and branched isomers have higher octane numbers than
straight-chain isomers with similar carbon numbers. Octane numbers for
naphthenes are substantially lower than those for aromatics.
Octane numbers do not blend linearly. For example, while the RON for
pure 4-methyl-2-pentene is 99, its blended RON is 130.
In North America, the pump octane of gasoline is the average of RON and
MON: (R+M)/2. This is the number displayed on pumps at filling stations.
Typical grades are “regular” with a pump octane of 87, “mid-grade” with a
pump octane of 89, and “premium” with a pump octane of 91 to 93. In some
locales, customers can dial in any octane they want between 87 and 93.

Many refinery streams have the right vapor pressure, boiling range, and
octane to end up in the gasoline pool. Table 23 shows properties for stocks
recently used to make gasoline in a European refinery. The raffinate came
from an aromatics extraction unit, and the pyrolysis gasoline came from a
nearby ethylene plant.

Reformulated Gasoline (RFG)

In 1970, gasoline blending became more complex. The U.S. Clean Air Act
required the phase-out of tetraethyl lead, so refiners had to find other ways to
provide octane. In 1990, the Clean Air Act was amended. It empowered EPA

Robinson

52

to impose emissions limits on automobiles and to require reformulated
gasoline (RFG).
Phase I RFG regulations (Table 24) required a minimum amount of
chemically bound oxygen, imposed upper limits on benzene and Reid Vapor
Pressure (RVP), and ordered a 15% reduction in volatile organic compounds
(VOC) and air toxics. VOC react with atmospheric NOx to produce groundlevel ozone. Air toxics include 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, benzene, and
formaldehyde.
Oxygen can be supplied as ethanol or C5 to C7 ethers. The ethers (Table
25) have excellent blending octanes and low vapor pressures. This makes
them highly desirable gasoline blend stocks. Due to the detection of MTBE in
ground water, the future for MTBE is questionable, especially since 1999, when
the Governor of California issued an executive order requiring the phase-out
of MTBE as a component of gasoline. But in Finland and many other
European countries, MTBE is still considered a premium, relatively safe
blend stock.33

RFG was implemented in two phases. The Phase I program started in 1995
and mandated RFG for 10 large metropolitan areas. Several other cities and
four entire states joined the program voluntarily. In the year 2000, about 35%
of the gasoline in the United States was reformulated.
The regulations for Phase II, which took force in January 2000, are based
on the EPA Complex Model, which estimates exhaust emissions for a region

based on geography, time of year, mix of vehicle types, and – most important
to refiners – fuel properties (Table 26).
By intent, Phase II is a regulation based on emissions instead of a formula.
But refiners don’t have to masure the trail-pipe emissions of every gasoline
blend. Instead, they can use EPA‘s computer model – called MOBILE6 – to
calculate emissions. By law, complex-model calculations are just as valid as
dynamometer tests with vehicles.

In practice, blending under the complex model can be less restrictive than
blending to a recipe, because changing the amount of one blend-stock (for
examples, due to a sudden increase or decrease in availability) can be offset
by changes in others.
8.2.3 Gasoline Additives
Table 27 lists the kinds of additives used to prepare finished gasoline.
Additive packages vary from season-to-season, region-to-region, and retailer
to retailer. “After-market” additives contain similar types of ingredients and
usually are more concentrated. They are packaged so that they can be added
by consumers to the fuel tanks of individual automobiles.

8.2.4 Low-Sulfur Gasoline and Ultra-Low-Sulfur Diesel
In recent years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
European Parliament promulgated clean-fuel regulations that are lowering the
sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel. New sulfur-content standards for
several developed countries are shown in Table 28, which also shows the
target dates for implementation.

Table 29 shows that, prior to 2004, FCC gasoline was by far the major
source of sulfur in gasoline,43 typically accounting for 85 – 95% of the total
sulfur in the blending pool.44 Obviously, to reduce the sulfur content of
gasoline, sulfur either must be kept out of FCC feed or removed from FCC
product(s). Both approaches are being used. FCC feed desulfurization is
discussed in Section 3.4.2. FCC gasoline post-treating is discussed below.

FCC Gasoline Post-Treating

Hydrotreating FCC Gasoline. Conventional hydrotreating does a good
job of removing sulfur from FCC gasoline. Unfortunately, it also does a good
job of reducing octane by saturating C6-C10 olefins. In recent years, the
industry has developed several processes to remove sulfur at minimum octane
loss. Licensors include Axens (IFP), CDTECH, ExxonMobil, and UOP.
Sulfur Removal by Selective Adsorption. The ConocoPhillips S Zorb
process uses selective adsorption to remove sulfur from FCC gasoline.44 The
feed is combined with a small amount of hydrogen, heated, and injected into
an expanded fluid-bed reactor, where a proprietary sorbent removes sulfur
from the feed. A disengaging zone in the reactor removes suspended sorbent
from the vapor, which exits the reactor as a low-sulfur stock suitable for
gasoline blending.
The sorbent is withdrawn continuously from the reactor and sent to the
regenerator section, where the sulfur is removed as SO2 and sent to a sulfur
recovery unit. The clean sorbent is reconditioned and returned to the reactor.
The rate of sorbent circulation is controlled to help maintain the desired sulfur
concentration in the product.

Kerosene and Jet Fuel

Kerosene, jet fuel, and turbine fuel have similar boiling ranges. The key
product properties are:
• Flash point
• Freezing point
• Sulfur content
• Smoke point

The flash point is the lowest temperature at which a liquid gives off
enough vapor to ignite when an ignition source is present. The freezing point
is especially important for jet aircraft, which fly at high altitudes where the
outside temperature is very low. Sulfur content is a measure of corrosiveness.
The measurement of smoke point goes back to the days when the primary
use for kerosene was to fuel lamps. To get more light from a kerosene lamp,
you could turn a little knob to adjust the wick. But if the flame got too high, it
gave off smoke. Even today, per ASTM D1322, smoke point is the maximum
height of flame that can be achieved with calibrated wick-fed lamp, using a
wick “of woven solid circular cotton of ordinary quality.”
The smoke point of a test fuel is compared to reference blends. A standard
40%/60% (volume/volume) mixture of toluene with 2,2,4-trimethylpentane
has a smoke point of 14.7, while pure 2,2,4-trimethylpentane has a smoke
point of 42.8. Clearly, isoparaffins have better smoke points than aromatics.

as aviation turbine fuel. The JP fuels are for military aircraft.

Diesel Blending

Diesel blending is simpler than gasoline blending because the limitations
are fewer. Only sulfur, cetane number, and (in some countries) aromatics and
density are regulated for environmental reasons. Sulfur contributes heavily to
particulate emissions from diesel engines, and cetane number is a measure of
burning quality in a diesel engine. As with octane number, cetane number
measures the tendency of fuels to auto-ignite in a standard test engine. It is
easier to start a diesel engine when the cetane number of the fuel is high.
The reference fuels for ASTM D613, which describes the test method for
cetane number, are n-cetane, α-methylnaphthalene, and heptamethylnonane,
for which cetane numbers are defined to be 100, 0, and 15, respectively.
Table 31 shows cetane numbers for selected pure compounds.45

Cetane index, as defined by ASTM D976, is not a measurement, but the
result of a calculation based on density and mid-boiling point. It is nearly the
same the as cetane number for diesel fuels comprised mostly of straight-run
gas oils blended with lesser amounts of cracked stocks. Diesel index is a
simpler calculation based on density and aniline point. The streams listed in
Table 32 are typical candidates for making diesel fuel.

Table 33 presents clean-diesel specifications for the European community,
which were based on two extensive research programs – Auto Oil I and Auto
Oil II. Automobile manufacturers, oil refining companies, and government
agencies participated in both programs. Auto Oil I lasted four years, from
1992 to 96. Auto Oil II was launched in 1997, and the final report was issued
in October 2000. The purpose of the programs was to find ways to reduce
emissions from gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, considering public
health, technology and economics.

As discussed elsewhere, diesel sulfur will be limited to 50 wppm in 2005.

Catalytic converters led to the elimination of lead from gasoline, because
lead poisons the converter catalyst. Similarly, sulfur poisons catalysts that
may be used on future vehicles. Hence, the reduction of sulfur in gasoline and
diesel fuel to ultra-low levels is a key requirement of Auto Oil II.
Around the world, the transportation and fungibility of ultra-clean fuels is
a major concern. For common-carrier pipelines, which transport various
products made by different refiners, cross-contamination is a major concern.
The interface layer between shipments is called “trans mix.” If a shipment of
gasoline containing 30 wppm of sulfur follows a batch of diesel containing
500 wppm of sulfur, the sulfur-contaminated trans mix could comprise more
than 20% of the gasoline. Consequently, several pipeline companies have
announced that in the future they will not transport any high-sulfur material.
Other important diesel-fuel properties include flash point, cloud point,
pour point, kinematic viscosity, and lubricity. Cloud point and pour point
indicate the temperature at which the fuel tends to thicken and then gel in cold
weather. In addition to providing energy, diesel fuel also serves as a lubricant
for fuel pumps and injectors, which prolongs the life of the engine. Viscosity
measures the tendency of a fluid to flow. In a diesel engine, viscosity
indicates how well a fuel atomizes in spray injectors. It also measures its
quality as a lubricant for the fuel system. Lubricity measures the fuel’s ability
to reduce friction between solid surfaces in relative motion. It indicates how
the engine will perform when loaded.
8.4.1 Diesel Additives
Chemical additives improve the performance and extend the tank-life of
diesel fuels. Typical types of additives are shown in Table 34.

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

The ways in which the refining industry protects the environment are
discussed in more detail in Chapter 14, Environmental Pollution Control. In
this section, we provide a brief overview of the methods used to improve air
quality, prevent water pollution, and dispose of solid wastes.

9.1

Air Quality

In the 1970s and 1980s, environmental laws compelled refineries to reduce
emissions of SOx, NOx, CO2, and hydrocarbons. In the atmosphere, SOx
reacts with water vapor to make sulfurous and sulfuric acids, which return to
earth as acid rain. Volatile hydrocarbons react with NOx to make ozone. CO2
is a major “green-house” gas. To reduce these pollutants, the industry
tightened its operation by:
• Reducing fugitive hydrocarbon emissions from valves and fittings
• Removing sulfur from refinery streams and finished products
• Adding tail-gas units to sulfur recovery plants
• Reducing the production of NOx in fired heaters
• Scrubbing SOx and NOx from flue gases
• Reducing the production of CO2 by increasing energy efficiency
9.1.1

Sulfur Recovery

Conversion processes, hydrotreaters, and sweetening units remove
chemically bound sulfur from petroleum fractions. That’s a good thing, but
where does the sulfur go? The answer depends upon the form in which it is
produced.
SOx Abatement. Fuel-oil fired heaters and the regenerators of FCC units
are major sources of refinery SOx and NOx emissions. The most obvious way
to reduce SOx emissions from a heater is to use low-sulfur fuels.
Unfortunately, although that solution requires no investment, it is probably

Robinson

60

the most expensive due to the relatively high cost of buying low-sulfur fuel oil
or hydrotreating high-sulfur fuel oil.
A large fraction of the sulfur in the feed to an FCC unit ends up in coke on
the catalyst. SOx is formed in the regenerator when the coke is burned away.
Therefore, removing sulfur from the feed decreases SOx emissions.
As stated in Section 3.4.2, using a hydrotreater or hydrocracker for feed
HDS eliminates or minimizes the cost of post-FCC desulfurization equipment.
Removing basic nitrogen decreases deactivation of acid sites on the FCC
catalyst, which allows the FCC to reach a given conversion at lower
temperatures. The saturation of aromatics in the feed pretreater provides the
biggest benefit, because it converts hard-to-crack aromatics into easier-tocrack naphthenes. This alone can justify the installation of an FCC feed
pretreater. Therefore, in addition to abating SOx, hydrotreating the feed to an
FCC can generate a substantial return.43
FCC Regenerator (Oxidizing Environment)
Coke on catalyst (solid) + O 2 + H2O → CO2 + SO2, SO3, Hy SOx (gas)
SO2, SO3, Hy SOx (gas) + M (solid) + O 2 → M.SO 4 (solid)
FCC Riser/Reactor (Reducing Environment)
M.SO4 (solid) + 5 H2 → M (solid) + H2S (gas) + 4 H2O
Figure 25. Mechanism of SOx transfer in FCC units.

SOx Transfer Additives. Arguably, SOx transfer additives are the most
cost-effective way to lower SOx emissions in an FCC unit. These materials,
first developed by Davison Chemical, react with SOx in the FCC regenerator
to form sulfates (Figure 25). When the sulfated additive circulates to the
riser/reactor section, the sulfate is reduced to H2S, which is recovered by
amine absorption and sent to the sulfur plant. In some units, these additives
reduce FCC SOx emissions by more than 70%. Consequently, if a pre-treater
or post-treater still must be installed, its size can be reduced.
Flue-Gas (Stack-Gas) Scrubbing. Flue-gas scrubbing is a refiner’s last
chance to keep NOx and SOx out of the air. In wet flue-gas desulfurization,
gas streams containing SOx react with an aqueous slurry containing calcium
hydroxide Ca(OH)2 and calcium carbonate CaCO3. Reaction products include
calcium sulfite (CaSO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4), which precipitate from
the solution.
NOx removal is more difficult. Wet flue-gas scrubbing removes about
20% of the NOx from a typical FCC flue gas. To remove the rest, chemical
reducing agents are used. In the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process,
anhydrous ammonia is injected into the flue gas as it passes through a bed of

Petroleum Processing Overview

61

catalyst at 500 to 950°F (260 to 510°C). The chemical reaction between NOx
and ammonia produces N2 and H2O.
Hydrogen Sulfide Removal. When sulfur-containing feeds pass through
hydrotreaters or conversion units, some or most of the sulfur is converted into
H2S, which eventually ends up in off-gas streams. Amine absorbers remove
the H2S, leaving only 10 to 20 wppm in the treated gas streams. H2S is steamstripped from the amines, which are returned to the absorbers. The H2S goes
to the refinery sulfur plant.

Figure 26. Claus reactions.

Claus Sulfur Recovery Process. At the sulfur plant, H2S is combined with
sour-water stripper off-gas and sent to a Claus unit. Invented in 1881 by Carl
Freidrich Claus,47 almost every refinery in the world uses some version of this
process to convert H2S into elemental sulfur. A simplified version of Clausreaction chemistry is shown in Figure 26.
Figure 27 shows a process schematic for a Claus unit. H2S and a carefully
controlled amount of air are mixed and sent to a burner, where about 33% of
the H2S is converted to SO2 and water. From the burner, the hot gases go to a
reaction chamber, where the reactions shown in Figure 26 reach equilibrium.
In several units, the air is enriched with oxygen to increase plant capacity.

Figure 27. Claus process.

Robinson

62

As shown, elemental sulfur is produced by the reversible reaction between
SO2 and H2S. COS and CS2 appear in small amounts, but even traces of these
compounds are hard to remove in tail-gas treating units. Ammonia comes in
with the sour-water stripper off-gas. In the Claus process, it is thermally
decomposed into nitrogen and water.
In the Claus burner, combustion temperatures reach 2200°F (1200°C).
Needless to say, this generates a tremendous amount of heat. Much of the heat
is recovered in a waste-heat boiler, which generates steam as it drops the
temperature to 700°F (370°C).
Next, the process gas goes to a condenser, where it is cooled to about
450°F (232°C). At this temperature, sulfur vapors condense, and the resulting
molten sulfur flows through a drain to a heated sulfur-collection pit. At the
bottom of the drain, a seal leg maintains system pressure and keeps
unconverted gases out of the pit.
Uncondensed sulfur and other gases flow to a series of catalyst beds,
which recover additional sulfur by promoting the reaction between left-over
H2S and SO2. With fresh catalyst and a stoichiometric gas composition, the
cumulative recovery of sulfur after the four condensers is about 50%, 80%,
95%, and 96-98%, respectively.
Tail-gas treating units (TGTU) bring the total sulfur recovery up to
>99.9%. Most tail-gas treating processes send the tail gas to a hydrotreater,
which converts all sulfur-containing compounds (SO2, SO3, COS, CS2 and Sx)
into H2S. In the SCOT process, offered by Shell Global Solutions, the H2S is
aborbed by an amine and returned to the front of the Claus furnace. In the LOCAT® process, offered by Merichem, H2S is air-oxidized to sulfur in an
aqueous solution containing a chelated iron catalyst.
For all tail-gas treatment processes, the last traces of unrecovered sulfur go
to an incinerator, where they are converted into SO2 and dispersed into the
atmosphere.

9.2

Waste Water Treatment

Waste water treatment is used to purify process water, runoff, and sewage.
As much as possible, purified waste-water steams are re-used in the refinery.
Wastewater streams may contain suspended solids, dissolved salts, phenols,
ammonia, sulfides, and other compounds. The streams come from just about
every process unit, especially those that use wash water, condensate, stripping
water, caustic, or neutralization acids.
9.2.1

Primary Treatment

Primary treatment uses a settling pond to allow most hydrocarbons and
suspended solids to separate from the wastewater. The solids drift to the

Petroleum Processing Overview

63

bottom of the pond, hydrocarbons are skimmed off the top, and oily sludge is
removed. Difficult oil-in-water emulsions are heated to expedite separation.
Acidic wastewater is neutralized with ammonia, lime, or sodium
carbonate. Alkaline wastewater is treated with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric
acid, carbon dioxide-rich flue gas, or sulfur.
9.2.2

Secondary Treatment

Some suspended solids remain in the water after primary treatment. These
are removed by filtration, sedimentation or air flotation. Flocculation agents
may be added to consolidate the solids, making them easier to remove by
sedimentation or filtration. Activated sludge is used to digest water-soluble
organic compounds, either in aerated or anaerobic lagoons. Steam-stripping is
used to remove sulfides and/or ammonia, and solvent extraction is used to
remove phenols.
9.2.3

Tertiary Treatment

Tertiary treatment processes remove specific pollutants, including traces
of benzene and other partially soluble hydrocarbons. Tertiary water treatment
can include ion exchange, chlorination, ozonation, reverse osmosis, or
adsorption onto activated carbon. Compressed oxygen may be used to
enhance oxidation. Spraying the water into the air or bubbling air through the
water removes remaining traces of volatile chemicals such as phenol and
ammonia.

9.3

Solid Waste

Refinery solid wastes may include the following materials:
Spent catalyst and catalyst fines
Acid sludge from alkylation units
Miscellaneous oil-contaminated solids
All oil-contaminated solids are treated as hazardous and sent to sanitary
landfills. Recently, super-critical extraction with carbon dioxide has been used
with great success to remove oil from contaminated dirt.

POWER, STEAM, HYDROGEN, AND CO2

Utilities are a critical ingredient in petroleum processing. After excluding
the cost of crude oil and other raw materials, power and steam account for
almost half of a refinery’s operating costs.

Robinson

64

Due to clean-fuel regulations, many refineries are implementing hydrogen
recovery/purification projects and/or installing steam/hydrocarbon reformers
to generate on-purpose hydrogen.

10.1

Power

Refineries purchase electricity from outside sources, but they also produce
much of their own power with steam turbines or gas engines. Electrical
substations distribute power throughout the facility. For safety reasons,
substations are located far away from sources of combustible vapors.

10.2

Steam

Steam production and distribution systems are quite complex, involving 3
to 4 different steam qualities and hundreds of pipes and valves. Cooling
towers and evaporators are used to dispose of unused steam.
Steam is generated by boilers and heat-producing process units. FCC units,
Claus units, and steam/hydrocarbon reformers (hydrogen plants) are major
sources of refinery steam.
Steam boilers are fired with refinery fuel gas, natural gas, and/or fuel oil.
Fuel oil is a blend of residual oils with flow-improving cutter stocks. Usually,
it is pumped through a series of strainers before being burned.
Refinery fuel gas is collected from process units, sweetened in amine
absorbers, and sent to a balance drum. Natural gas and LPG may be used to
augment the fuel gas supply, and to replace it when needed. The balance drum
stabilizes system pressure and calorific content. It also provides a place for
suspended liquids to separate from the gas.
Boiler feedwater (BFW) is used for steam generation. BFW must be free
of contaminants, because salts and dissolved gases, particularly CO2 and O2,
can cause extensive corrosion.

10.3

Hydrogen and CO2

Due to the extra hydrotreating required by clean-fuel regulations, refiners
are looking for additional sources of hydrogen, which can be recovered from
off-gas streams or generated by new hydrogen plants. Chapter 26 by Nick
Hallale, Ian Moore and Dennis Vauk describes a methodology for optimizing
hydrogen recovery from existing refinery hydrogen networks. For new
hydrogen plants, steam-hydrocarbon reforming is used. This process is
described in detail in Chapter 26 by Andrew Crews and Gregory Shumake
and in the Chapter 25 by Milo Meixell. A brief overview is given in this section.
The feed gas for a steam-hydrocarbon reformer can be natural gas, refinery
off-gas, or a mixture of the two. The feed gas is desulfurized, mixed with

Petroleum Processing Overview

65

superheated steam and sent through tubes packed with a nickel-based catalyst.
Reaction temperatures are very high – 1100 to 1600°F (593 to 871°C).
The reformed gas, which contains water vapor, H2, CO, and CO2, is sent
through a high-temperature shift (HTS) converter. In the HTS converter,
carbon monoxide reacts with steam over an iron-based catalyst to form
additional CO2 and hydrogen.
In modern units, the CO2 and residual CO and CH4 are removed by
pressure-swing adsorption (PSA). As an option, residual CO is converted to
methane in a hydrotreater.
In older units, CO2 is removed with an absorber containing an amine,
Sulfinol®, Rectisol® or by the BenfieldTM process, which uses hot potassium
carbonate. Recovered CO2 can be sold as a product.

11.

REFINING ECONOMICS

11.1

Costs

The purchase of crude oil and external blend stocks accounts for about
85% of a refinery’s operating costs. About half of the remaining 15% is due to
energy in the form of fuel and electrical power. Table 35 shows a typical
breakdown of plant-wide operating costs. For the refining industry, labor
costs are about 2.3% of sales compared to 7.6% for making automobile
bodies, 8.3% for plastics, and 12.7% for computers.48
About half of the energy used by a refinery is generated from crude oil. In
Table 35, crude oil used for energy production is included with “Crude oil and
blend stocks.” Corporate overhead, interest payments, taxes, and capital
depreciation are not included in this analysis.

Ultimately, prices for crude oil are set by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which are listed in Table 36. The
members of OPEC supply about 40% of the world’s oil production and own

Robinson

66

about 75% of the world’s proven oil reserves; consumption within OPEC is
very low, so almost all of the produced oil is exported.

Figure 28 illustrates how oil prices have changed since 1861.50 The
bottom trend shows the actual historical prices. The top trend converts the
historical prices into 2002 dollars. The big spikes in 1973 and 1978-81
correspond to actions taken by the OPEC cartel. In 1973, the first Arab Oil
Embargo caused the average price of oil to rise from about US$4 per barrel to
more than US$10 per barrel. In 1978, the revolution in Iran triggered another
steep increase in prices, which peaked in 1981 at about US$38 per barrel.

In response to these severe price increases, major oil-consuming countries
developed alternatives and implemented energy conservation measures. The
member countries of OEDC (Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development) decreased oil demand from 44 million b/d in 1979 to 37

Petroleum Processing Overview

67

million b/d in 1985. Significantly, France now gets more than 75% of its
electricity from nuclear power plants, and most of the rest is hydroelectric.
Slowly but steadily, oil consumption rose from 58 million b/d in 1983 to 75
million b/d in 2002. Most of the rise came from developing countries (Figure
29). The price run-up in 2003-05 was caused by increased rates of rising demand
in China and India, whose economies were booming. At the same time, there was
an (apparent) inability of exporters to keep pace with demand and a lack of spare
refining capacity, especially in North America.

Figure 29. Worldwide Petroleum Processing Capacity Since 1973

Sudden changes in consumption, either up or down, are unlikely due
to the long lead-time needed to increase population, build new refining
capacity, build plants that produce energy from alternative sources, or
implement energy conservation measures. It takes 18 to 24 months to design
and install a new crude distillation unit. Alternative energy production
plants take a lot longer, especially in the United States, where it takes years
to obtain permits for a new plant of significant size.
“Everybody wants power, but nobody wants a power plant in his yard.”
In contrast, supply can change overnight – at least in the minds of oil traders.

Table 37. In each case, one major contributor accounts for most of the
operating costs. Hydrotreating is an “enabling” process with low margins, but
it is essential to the proper functioning of many other units in a refinery.

Margins

Refinery margins depend on location, size, automation, complexity, and crude
and product prices. A good indicator of margins is the “crack spread” – the
difference in price between crude oil and refined products.
11.3.1 Location, Location, Location
A well-located refinery has lower operating costs and increased operating
flexibility. When located near other refineries and petrochemical plants in a
coastal industrial basin such as Rotterdam, the Houston Ship Channel, etc., it
has access to a wide variety of crudes, blend stocks, transportation options,
additives, supplies, and services. This enhances its ability to cope with upsets
and to react aggressively to sudden changes in price differentials.
In a basin, the infrastructure – seaports, pipelines, laboratories, wastehandling facilities – is extensive. Often, a single large supplier provides
utilities and commodities such as hydrogen to several different customers,
reducing costs for all concerned. This is because, due to economies of scale,
production and distribution costs for a large plant are lower than those for
multiple smaller plants with equivalent total capacity.
As long as space is available, industrial basins tend to grow. They also
attract and support large pools of operators and engineers. Contractors, who
perform as-needed engineering, maintenance, and other important service
work, also are attracted by “basin gravitation.”
Lest we leave you with the idea that non-basin facilities are inherently
handicapped, we should emphasize that other locations also can have
advantages. For example, the ConocoPhillips refinery in Borger, Texas was
built in 1932 in an area that still produces large quantities of natural-gas
liquids. Except for a few nearby chemical plants, the Borger refinery seems
isolated. However, it is connected by pipelines to the U.S. Gulf Coast and to
the mammoth hub of pipelines in Cushing, Oklahoma. Through these various
pipelines, the Borger complex receives crude oil from the Texas Gulf Coast
and supplies products to Houston, Denver, Kansas City, and beyond. Also, in

Petroleum Processing Overview

69

addition to gasoline and other fuels, it produces a large number of ultra-pure
chemicals, some of which are not manufactured in quantity anywhere else in
the United States.
11.3.2 Size
Size isn’t everything, but it certainly helps. On a per-ton basis, it costs less
to design and build large process units. Engineering costs are essentially
capacity-independent. This economy of scale translates into higher returns on
investments, faster paybacks, and/or reduced interest payments as percentages
of total project costs.
Similarly, bigger plants have lower per-barrel operating costs because many
fixed costs, especially labor, are nearly size-independent.
Size and weight determine the maximum size of for the vessels in large
process units. High-pressure reactors can only be built in a few special factories
in Italy and Japan. They can weigh more than 2200 tons and their diameters may
exceed 15 feet (5 meters), but it must be possible to move them over existing
road and to lift them with available cranes.
11.3.3 Conversion Capability and Complexity
The most profitable refineries tend to be more complex. In the 1960s,
W.L. Nelson developed an index for calculating the relative costs of refineries
based on complexity.51 Table 38 presents complexity indices for individual
processes, and Table 39 compares complexity in different parts of the world.

To compute the Nelson Index for a given refinery or regions, the
complexity factors for each individual unit is multiplied by the percentage of
the incoming crude that it processes. The individual unit results are summed
to give a total plant complexity rating.

In short: The petroleum refining business is highly capital-intensive and
competition is fierce. The predominant cost – purchase of crude oil – is
beyond a refiner’s control, due to the fact that crude-oil costs are, for the most
part, determined by OPEC. Even so, large, well-located, high-conversion
refineries can be very profitable, especially during spikes in product prices. In
2005, crack spreads reached all-time highs, exceeding $15 per barrel in most
of the United States and >$20 per barrel in California.
11.3.4 Automation
As discussed in Chapter 22, model-predictive control (MPC) and real-time
optimization (RTO) can improve the profitability of a major conversion unit
by 5 to 10%. Refinery-wide, benefits from MPC and RTO can exceed
US$0.40 per barrel, or $US30 million per year for a high-conversion 200,000
b/d refinery.

12.

SAFETY, RELIABILITY, AND MAINTENANCE

This section could have been a part of Section 11: Refining Economics,
because the most profitable refineries are also the safest and most reliable.
Just consider this: For a 200,000 barrels-per-day refinery, a minor accident
that shuts down the plant for just one week can cost US$3 to 6 million in lost
revenue. An accident that damages a major conversion unit can cost between
US$80 and US$120 million in lost revenue during the 12-18 months required
for reconstruction, plus US$20 to 50 million (or more) in reconstruction
expenses. These estimates don’t include the cost of repairing damage to the
surrounding community. To settle lawsuits and pay penalties for a “minor”
incident that occurred in 1994, a California refiner paid more than US$83
million.52

More than anything else, safety and reliability depend on people who work
in a plant. A typical U.S. or Canadian refinery employs 500 to 750 people.
About half of these are operators and 20 to 25% are engineers.

12.2

Safety

“Safety first!”
“Safety is a state of mind.”
“All accidents are preventable.”
In safely operated plants, these maxims are emphasized over and over
again to each and every employee. Industry studies show that safe plants share
the following characteristics:
• Top managers demonstrate personal commitment to safety.
• Safety goals are aggressive. A perfect example of an aggressive goal is
“Zero Lost-Time Accidents.”
• Safe performance is rewarded. For achieving aggressive safety goals,
individual workers can receive thousands of dollars per year.
• Safety takes priority over (false) economics. In safety-first plants,
operators are encouraged to shut a unit down at the first sign of serious
trouble. Historically, far too many incidents are caused (or aggravated) by
someone who decides to keep running a unit despite indications that
something is wrong.52

Robinson

72

•

Protective clothing is required. Anyone in an operations area must wear
fire-proof coveralls, a helmet, and safety goggles. Hearing protection and
steel-toed shoes may also be required.
• Safety equipment is well-maintained and readily available. Safety
equipment includes alarms, intercoms, sprinkler systems, self-contained
breathing units, and first-aid kits.
• Safety training is rigorous and continuous. Training topics include:
o Safety regulations. In the United States, safety regulations are issued
and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA). Per OSHA requirements, for every chemical in the plant, a
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) must be available. An MSDS
describes the substance, classifies its danger, if any, and describes
proper storage and handling.
o Emergency procedures, including where to go and what to do when
they hear different alarms. Usually, there are at least two kinds of
alarm sounds – a fire alarm and a toxic-release alarm. Possible toxic
releases include H2S, which is actually more poisonous than hydrogen
cyanide, and carbon monoxide.
o Maintenance safety. Historically, most refinery accidents occurred
during maintenance. Now, all proposed maintenance work is
reviewed and pre-approved by operations, engineering, craftspeople
and management. Lock-out, tag-out procedures prevent unsuspecting
employees from trying to start equipment that shouldn’t be started.
• Contractors must be trained, too. Before they can enter the plant, all
contractors are required to complete safety training.
Safety programs work! For example, a report by ChevronTexaco claims
that, between 1990-91 and 2000-01, safety programs reduced injuries by 90%
at its large refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. 53 In 2003, Valero’s Paulsboro
refinery had no lost-time injuries and a total recorded injury rate of 0.7, which
is three times better than the industry average. For this and other
achievements, the refinery was one of only 13 in the United States to be
honored as “Star Site” within OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program
(VPP). In addition, the plant earned four national safety awards from the
National Petroleum Refiners Association (NPRA). “Our successful VPP
efforts have taken the commitment of every person in this refinery, and I’m
proud of how everybody has worked together as a team to make it a safety
leader,” said Mike Pesch, vice president and manager of the refinery.54

12.3

Reliability and Maintenance

Most refinery maintenance takes place during scheduled shut-downs,
when refinery personnel, often with help from contractors, clean, inspect,
maintain and (if necessary) repair equipment.

Petroleum Processing Overview

73

During a major turnaround, process vessels are drained and filled or
blanketed with nitrogen gas. In conversion units, catalysts are unloaded and
the reactors are metallurgically “pacified” with chemicals such as aqueous
sodium carbonate. The process units are inspected, and pre-planned revamps
are implemented. Reactors are re-loaded, either with fresh or regenerated
catalysts, and the unit is re-started.
Maintenance planning is complex. Complete planning and competent
management are prerequisites to success.55

The oil industry has been consolidating since oil prices exploded during
1978-81, after the revolution in Iran. According to the United States Energy
Information Administration,56 in 1981 there were 324 refineries in the United
States (Figure 31). Ten years later, there were 202, and by the end 2002 there
were 153. Interestingly, during that same time-frame, the total capacity
dropped from 18.6 million b/d to a low of 15.0 million b/d in 1994. It then
climbed back to 16.8 million b/d by the end of 2002. The average capacity
nearly doubled, from 57,400 b/d in 1981 to 109,700 b/d in 2002.

It’s tempting to conclude that 171 refineries were shut down during the
past 20-plus years and the remaining plants got a whole lot bigger. Indeed,
there were a lot of shut-downs and expansions, but that’s not the whole story.
In many cases, mergers between neighbors decreased the apparent number of

Robinson

74

plants without affecting capacity, because equipment from both predecessors
continues to run at full rate. For example, the 300,000 b/d Flint Hills refinery
in Corpus Christi, Texas used to be three separate plants owned by Koch
Refining, Gulf States and Kerr-McGee.
Trends are similar in Western Europe. Total capacity has levelled off, but
the number of refineries has decreased, in part due to mergers. Plants owned
by BP and Texaco were merged to form the 380,000 b/d Netherlands Refining
Company (NeRefCo). MiRO, a 283,000 b/d refinery in Karlsruhe, Germany,
was created by a merger between refineries owned by Esso and by the by the
four OMW partners – DEA, Conoco, Veba, and Petroleos de Venezuela.
In recent years, consolidation has evolved from relatively small mergers
between neighboring refineries into mega-mergers between fully integrated
oil corporations. Many of these are listed in Table 40.

13.2

Environmental Regulations

A second main trend in petroleum processing – tightening environmental
regulations – started in 1970 and accelerated in recent years. Major areas of
improvement include:
• Reduced fugitive emissions. This requires modification or replacement of
valves and compressor seals, along with more-vigilant maintenance.
• Reduced particulate emissions. To reduce emission of particulates, better
cyclones and high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators are being added to
FCC units. At delayed coking units, enclosed coke conveyors and storage
systems have been installed.
• Reduced CO, SOx, and NOx emissions. Reduction of carbon monoxide
emissions requires improved efficiency in the CO boilers of FCC units.
SOx emissions from FCC units are being reduced by the hydrotreating of
feedstocks, the use of SOx-transfer additives, and the addition of flue-gas
scrubbing. At some plants, limitations on NOx may require the addition
of post-combustion NOx-removal on boilers and heaters.
• Heat-efficiency, CO2. Energy is the largest controllable cost for a refinery.
Therefore, the drive to increase heat efficiency is ever-present, especially
in crude distillation units and other major energy consumers. In countries
honoring the Kyoto protocol, decreased energy consumption also

Petroleum Processing Overview

decreases CO2 emissions. Therefore, refineries in some of these countries
are receiving tax credits for energy conservation projects.
Clean water. Regulations in OECD countries require that the quality of
water leaving a refinery must be at least as good as the water that enters.
Tertiary treatment technology is being installed to remove lingering traces
of benzene, phenols, nitrates, ammonia, and other undesirable chemicals.
Reformulated gasoline. The need for higher octane and lower RVP in
reformulated gasoline is increasing the need for alkylate and isomerate. In
some catalytic reformers, severity is being reduced. Others are being
converted to BTX service. More recently, MTBE units are being used for
alternative purposes, such as alkylate production.
Low-sulfur fuels. Recent rules limiting the sulfur content of gasoline and
diesel fuel are stimulating hydrotreater revamps and the installation of a
large number of new hydrotreaters. This in turn is requiring an increase in
sulfur recovery and hydrogen-production capacity. From a processdevelopment standpoint, the need to produce low-sulfur fuels has driven
the development of new processes – SCANfining, OCTGAIN, S Zorb
Prime-G, and others – for post-treating gasoline. To prevent the
contamination of ultra-clean products, storage tanks and pipelines are
being re-rated.

13.3

Residue Upgrading

The need for more and more heavy oil processing has been a trend since
the start of the industry. Year by year the density and sulfur content of
available crudes has slowly but surely been rising. Perhaps the discovery of
some new oil field will change this trend, but for now, if refiners wish to
continue meeting the demand for light products, they’ll have to be able to
process heavier feeds.
Several residue upgrading processes were mentioned in previous sections,
and are described in the following chapters. The main processes are:
• Delayed coking
• Fluid-bed coking (FLEXIcoking)
• Residue hydrotreating (RDS, OCR/UFR, Resid Unionfining)
• Residue FCC (RFCC)
• Solvent deasphalting (ROSE® process)

13.4

Increased Oil Consumption in Developing Countries

The trends in Figure 29 show that consumption of oil in OECD countries
has stabilized, but consumption in the non-OECD world continues to increase.
According to an article by Jeffrey Brown of FACTS Inc.,57 China led the way

Robinson

76

with 451,000 b/d of growth in 2003. Overall, Asia accounted for 664,000 b/d
of the 1.6 million b/d of global incremental demand growth in 2003.
China will continue to drive consumption growth and affect regional
product trade, prices, and refining margins. India is also likely to return to
higher growth, and the region’s midsized markets, such as Thailand and
Indonesia, will post strong growth. In 2004, FACTS Inc. expects demand
growth of 386,000 b/d in China, 22,000 b/d in South Korea, and 31,000 b/d in
India. After 2004, average worldwide petroleum demand will increase by 2.5
to 3.0% per year, with Asia accounting for about half of the growth.

13.5

Automation

Advanced process control (APC) and model-predictive control (MPC) are
widely used in the industry. Real-time optimization (RTO) is rather new, but
its acceptance is growing Chapter 22.
APC, MPC and RTO require modern instrumentation, which includes
actuator valves, distributed control systems (DCS), high-flux data highways,
analyzers, and dedicated computers. They also require trained support staff,
which at this writing is in short supply.

14.

SUMMARY

Modern petroleum processing started in 1860. During the past 14 decades,
it has grown in response to market drivers, particularly the demand for
transportation fuels. In recent years, in response to economic drivers and
pressure from environmental regulations, the industry has been changing.
We sincerely hope this book is a help to people who wish to gain a better
understanding of the industry today.
